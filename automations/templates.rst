    :description: Guide for using templates in ESPHome
    :image: auto-fix.svg

*Templates* (also known as *lambdas*) allow you to do almost *anything* in ESPHome. For example, if you want to only
perform a certain automation if a certain complex formula evaluates to true, you can do that with templates. Let's look
at an example first:

.. code-block:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        name: "Cover End Stop"
        id: top_end_stop
    cover:
      - platform: template
        name: Living Room Cover
        lambda: !lambda |-
          if (id(top_end_stop).state) {
            return COVER_OPEN;
          } else {
            return COVER_CLOSED;
          }

What's happening here? First, we define a binary sensor (notably with ``id: top_end_stop``) and then a
:doc:`template cover </components/cover/template>`. (If you're new to Home Assistant, a 'cover' is something like a
window blind, a roller shutter, or a garage door.) The *state* of the template cover is controlled by a template, or
"lambda". In lambdas, you're just writing C++ code and therefore the name lambda is used instead of Home Assistant's
"template" lingo to avoid confusion. Regardless, don't let lambdas scare you just because you saw "C++" -- writing
lambdas is not that hard! Here's a bit of a primer:

First, you might have already wondered what the ``lambda: !lambda |-`` part is supposed to mean. ``!lambda`` tells
ESPHome that the following block is supposed to be interpreted as a lambda, or C++ code. Note that here, the
``lambda:`` key would actually implicitly make the following block a lambda, so in this context, you could also have
written ``lambda: |-``.

Next, there's the weird ``|-`` character combination. This tells the YAML parser to treat the following **indented**
block as plaintext. Without it, the YAML parser would attempt to read the following block as if it were made up of YAML
keys like ``cover:`` for example. (You may also have seen variations of this like ``>-`` or just ``|`` or ``>``. There
is a slight difference in how these different styles deal with whitespace, but for our purposes we can ignore that).

With ``if (...) { ... } else { ... }`` we create a *condition*. What this effectively says that if the thing inside the
first parentheses evaluates to ``true`` then execute the first block (in this case ``return COVER_OPEN;``, or else
evaluate the second block. ``return ...;`` makes the code block give back a value to the template. In this case, we're
either *returning* ``COVER_OPEN`` or ``COVER_CLOSED`` to indicate that the cover is closed or open.

Finally, ``id(...)`` is a helper function that makes ESPHome fetch an object with the supplied ID (which you defined
somewhere else, like ``top_end_stop``) and lets you call any of ESPHome's many APIs directly. For example, here we're
retrieving the current state of the end stop using ``.state`` and using it to construct our cover state.

.. note::

    ESPHome does not check the validity of lambda expressions you enter and will blindly copy them into the generated
    C++ code. If compilation fails or something else is not working as expected with lambdas, it's always best to look
    at the generated C++ source file under ``<NODE_NAME>/src/main.cpp``.

.. tip::

    To store local variables inside lambdas that retain their value across executions, you can create ``static``
    variables as shown in the example below. Here, the variable ``num_executions`` is incremented by one each time the
    lambda is executed and the current value is logged.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        lambda: |-
          static int num_executions = 0;
          ESP_LOGD("main", "I am at execution number %d", num_executions);
          num_executions += 1;

.. _config-templatable:

Templating Actions
------------------

ESPHome allows you to template most parameters for actions used in automations. For example, if you have a light and
want to set it to a pre-defined color when a button is pressed, you can do this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_press:
      then:
        - light.turn_on:
            id: some_light_id
            transition_length: 0.5s
            red: 0.8
            green: 1.0
            blue: !lambda |-
              // The sensor outputs values from 0 to 100. The blue
              // part of the light color will be determined by the sensor value.
              return id(some_sensor).state / 100.0;

When you see the label "templatable" in the documentation for a given action, it can be templated as in this example,
using the lambda syntax as described/shown above.
