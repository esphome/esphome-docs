Migrating from previous Sonoff Tasmota setups is very easy. You just need to have
ESPHome create a binary for you and then upload that in the Tasmota web interface.

Getting the Binary
------------------

First follow the guides for the :ref:`different supported devices <devices>` and create a configuration
file. Then, generate and download the binary:

- **Using the Home Assistant add-on/dashboard**: Just click the ``COMPILE``
  button, wait for the compilation to end and press the ``DOWNLOAD BINARY``
  button.

- **Using the command line**: run ``esphome livingroom.yaml compile`` (replacing
  ``livingroom.yaml`` with your configuration file of course) and navigate to the
  ``<NODE_NAME>/.pioenvs/<NODE_NAME>/`` folder. There you will find a ``firmware.bin`` file.
  This is the binary that you will upload.

Uploading the Binary
--------------------

To upload the binary, navigate to the Tasmota web interface and enter the
"Firmware Upgrade" section.

In the "Upgrade by file upload" section, choose the binary you previously downloaded

If everything succeeds, you will see an "Upload Successful" message and ESPHome
will connect to the WiFi network configured in your .yaml file. ðŸŽ‰

Happy Hacking!

.. note::

    When using the :doc:`esp8266_pwm output </components/output/esp8266_pwm>` platform and
    switching from Tasmota, you need to power-cycle the device once. After that
    the dimming functionality will work as usual and no more power cycles are required.


.. note::

    If you are using Tasmota 8+ and get an error after uploading the firmware, go to the console and type ```SetOption78 1```, then restart the device and try the firmware again.
