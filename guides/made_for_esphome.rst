    :image: /_static/made-for-esphome-black-on-white.png

ESPHome has a wonderful and active community that loves creating and sharing projects.
You can apply for your project to get the ``Made for ESPHome`` stamp of approval.
This ensures that your project is powered by ESPHome and guarantees a minimum level of customizability to users.

Requirements
------------

There are a number of requirements your project must meet. These may vary based on its design. They are:

For projects which utilize Wi-Fi
********************************

Wi-Fi is quite common but requires configuration of the SSID and passphrase.
As such, for easy end-user provisioning, your configuration must include:

- ``esp32_improv`` as described in :doc:`/components/esp32_improv`
- ``improv_serial`` as described in :doc:`/components/improv_serial`, if a USB connection is available (recommended)

Note that these are **not** required for projects that only provide a physical/wired Ethernet port for connectivity.

For all projects
****************

- Your project is powered by ESPHome (runs ESPHome as its firmware)
- Your project is powered by an ESP32 or *supported* ESP32 variant such as the S2, S3, C3, etc.
- Your ESPHome configuration is open source, available for end users to modify/update
- Users should be able to apply updates if your project sells ready-made devices
- Your project supports adoption via the ``dashboard_import`` feature of ESPHome (see :doc:`Sharing </guides/creators>`). In particular:
    - There are **no** references to secrets or passwords
    - Network configuration must assume defaults (no static IPs or DNS configured)
    - It **must** compile successfully without any user changes after adopting it.
    - All configuration is contained within a single YAML file. Fully remote packages are permitted if using ``import_full_config: true``.
- Your product name cannot contain "**ESPHome**" except in the case of *ending with* "**for ESPHome**"

When your project matches all requirements of the Made for ESPHome program,
you can apply for permission to carry the logo by emailing esphome@nabucasa.com
