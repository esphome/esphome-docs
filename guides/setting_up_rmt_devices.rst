Setting up IR Devices
=====================

In this guide an infrared device will be set up with ESPHome. First, the remote code
will be captured with an IR receiver module (like `this one <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266>`__).
We will use ESPHome's dumping ability to output the decoded remote code directly.

Then we will set up a new remote transmitter with an infrared LED (like
`this one <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ir-communication/all>`__) to transmit the
code when a button is pressed.

First, connect the infrared receiver module to a pin on your board and set up a
remote_receiver instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIOXX
      dump: all

Compile and upload the code. While viewing the log output from the ESP,
press a button on an infrared remote you want to capture (one at a time).

You should see log output like below:

.. code-block:: text

    # If the codec is known:
    [D][remote.panasonic] Received Panasonic: address=0x4004 command=0x8140DFA2

    # Or raw output if it's not known yet
    # The values may fluctuate a bit, but as long as they're similar it's ok
    [D][remote.raw] Received Raw: 4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
    [D][remote.raw]   -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
    [D][remote.raw]   1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022

If the codec is already implemented in ESPHome, you will see the decoded value directly -
otherwise you will see the raw data dump (which you can use just as well). You have
just successfully captured your first infrared code.

Now let's use this information to emulate a button press from the ESP. First, wire up the
IR diode to a new pin on the ESP and configure a global ``remote_transmitter`` instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      # Infrared remotes use a 50% carrier signal
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

This will allow us to send any data we want via the IR LED. To replicate the codes we decoded
earlier, create a new template button that sends the infrared code when triggered:

.. code-block:: yaml

    button:
      - platform: template
        name: Panasonic Power Button
        on_press:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_panasonic:
              address: 0x4004
              command: 0x8140DFA2

    # Or for raw code
    button:
      - platform: template
        name: Raw Code Power Button
        on_press:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_raw:
              carrier_frequency: 38kHz
              code: [4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
                     -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
                     1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022]

Recompile again, when you power up the device the next time you will see a new button
in the frontend. Click on it and you should see the remote signal being transmitted. Done!

.. _remote-setting-up-rf:

Setting up RF Devices
=====================

The ``remote_transmitter`` and ``remote_receiver`` components can also be used to send
and receive 433MHz Radio Frequency (RF) signals. This guide will discuss setting up a 433MHz
receiver to capture a device's remote codes. After that we will set up a 433MHz transmitter
to replicate the remote code with the press of a button in the frontend.

First, connect the RF module to a pin on the ESP and set up a remote_receiver instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIOXX
      dump: all
      # Settings to optimize recognition of RF devices
      tolerance: 50%
      filter: 250us
      idle: 4ms
      buffer_size: 2kb # only for ESP8266

Compile and upload the code. While viewing the log output from the ESP,
press a button on an RF remote you want to capture (one at a time).

You should see log output like below:

.. code-block:: text

    # If the codec is known:
    [D][remote.rc_switch] Received RCSwitch: protocol=2 data='100010000000000010111110'

    # Or raw output if it's not known yet
    # The values may fluctuate a bit, but as long as they're similar it's ok
    [D][remote.raw] Received Raw: 4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
    [D][remote.raw]   -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
    [D][remote.raw]   1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022

.. note::

    If the log output is flooded with "Received Raw" messages, you can also disable raw
    remote code reporting and rely on rc_switch to decode the values.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        remote_receiver:
          pin: GPIOXX
          dump:
            - rc_switch
          ...

If the codec is already implemented in ESPHome, you will see the decoded value directly -
otherwise you will see the raw data dump (which you can use just as well). You have
just successfully captured your first RF code.

Now let's use this information to emulate a button press from the ESP. First, wire up the
RF transmitter to a new pin on the ESP and configure a global ``remote_transmitter`` instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      # RF uses a 100% carrier signal
      carrier_duty_percent: 100%

This will allow us to send any data we want via the RF transmitter. To replicate the codes we decoded
earlier, create a new template button that sends the RF code when triggered:

.. code-block:: yaml

    button:
      - platform: template
        name: RF Power Button
        optimistic: true
        on_press:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_rc_switch_raw:
              code: '100010000000000010111110'
              protocol: 2
              repeat:
                times: 10
                wait_time: 0s


    # Or for raw code
    button:
      - platform: template
        name: Raw Code Power Button
        on_press:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_raw:
              code: [4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
                     -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
                     1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022]

Recompile again, when you power up the device the next time you will see a new button
in the frontend. Click on it and you should see the remote signal being transmitted. Done!

.. note::

    Some devices require that the transmitted code be repeated for the signal to be picked up
    as valid. Also the interval between repetitions can be important. Check that the pace of
    repetition logs are consistent between the remote controller and the transmitter node.
    You can adjust the ``repeat:`` settings accordingly.
