Migrating from previous ESPEasy setups is very easy. You just need to have
ESPHome create a binary for you and then upload that in the ESPEasy web interface.

Getting Binary
--------------

First follow the guides for the :ref:`different supported devices <devices>` and create a configuration
file. Then, generate and download the binary:

- **Using the Home Assistant add-on/dashboard**: Just click the ``COMPILE`` button,
  wait for the compilation to end and press the ``DOWNLOAD BINARY`` button.

- **Using the command line**: run ``esphome livingroom.yaml compile`` (replacing
  ``livingroom.yaml`` with your configuration file of course) and navigate to the
  ``<NODE_NAME>/.pioenvs/<NODE_NAME>/`` folder. There you will find a ``firmware.bin`` file,
  this is the binary you will upload.

Uploading Binary
----------------

To upload the binary, navigate to the ESPEasy web interface and enter the
"Tools " section.

Press "Load" under Firmware, then select the binary you previously downloaded and upload
the binary. If everything succeeds, you should now have ESPHome on your node ðŸŽ‰.

.. note::

    with ESPHome, you in most cases won't need to worry about the available flash size, as
    the binary only ever includes the code that you are actually using.

Happy Hacking!
