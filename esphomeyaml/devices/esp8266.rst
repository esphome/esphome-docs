All ESP8266-based devices are supported by esphomeyaml. Simply select ``ESP8266`` when
the esphomeyaml wizard asks you for your platform and choose a board type
from `this link <http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif8266.html>`__ when the wizard
asks you for the board type.


.. code:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphomeyaml:
      name: livingroom
      platform: ESP8266
      board: <BOARD_TYPE>

Many boards have a pin numbering for the exposed pins that is different from the internally used
ones. esphomeyaml tries to map the silk-screen pin numbers into the internal pin numbers with a few
boards, but for generic ESP8266 boards it is often required to just use the internal pin numbers.
To do this, just prefix all pins with ``GPIO``, for example ``GPIO0`` for the pin with the internal pin
number 0.

Some notes on the pins:

- ``GPIO6`` - ``GPIO11``, ``GPIO0``, ``GPIO2`` and ``GPIO15`` are often already used by the internal
  flash interface and boot mode detection. So it's best to avoid using these pins.
- ``GPIO17`` additionally has an ADC connected to it. See the :doc:`/esphomeyaml/components/sensor/adc`
  to read out voltages (in the range from 0 to 1.0V) on this pin.


.. code:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphomeyaml:
      name: livingroom
      platform: ESP8266
      board: nodemcuv2

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        name: "Pin GPIO17"
        pin: GPIO17
