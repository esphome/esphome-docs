H801 RGBW LED controller
========================

| The H801 is pretty afordable and easy to hack and adapt to your needs. It can be found on `Aliexpress <https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bbnUDBZW>`__
| `Here <http://tinkerman.cat/closer-look-h801-led-wifi-controller/>`__ is an article about the hardware for those who have an interest for more details about the board.
| It can be used as a RGB, RGBW, RGB dual white or even control 5 individual monochromatic strips if you want or combinations of these.

For esphomelib, you can then use the :doc:`RGBW </esphomeyaml/components/light/rgbw.html>` 
and the :doc:`ESP8266 Software PWM output </esphomeyaml/components/output/esp8266_pwm.html>` components using below configuration (the commented out code is for the RBG cold white strip in pictures):

Make your node in the esphome dashboard and compile/upload it. (The binary will be too big for OTA, or rather there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of memory in this device you'll have to upload it via the serial adapter every time)

This LED stip can be used with the sketch as-is

For this type of led strip you have to swap the white and blue gpio numbers in the sketch


|
| You will need to solder pins to the board inside the h801 (fortunately its pretty roomy and not a lot of components or stuff in the way part from the 2 wires on the back)

| 3.3v, GND, TX and RX needs to be connected to your serial adapter, the two other pins must be shorted by a jumper or a breadboard cable when flashing. 
| (Remember to remove it afterwards)
