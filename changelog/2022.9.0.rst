ESPHome Editor
--------------

The editor used in ESPHome has been swapped out for Monaco thanks to :ghuser:`glmnet`. He has
been working hard to make the experience of writing your YAML configurations easier and it now
supports auto completion with popups to show you more information.

Factory Reset
-------------

A new Factory Reset switch and button has been added this release, allowing resetting of information such
as counters, restored values, and more importantly, the wifi credentials of a device that has been set up
using the captive portal such as pre-flashed devices you would have purchased.

Bluetooth Active Connections
----------------------------

ESPHome 2022.9.3 adds active connections to the ``bluetooth_proxy`` component allowing Home Assistant
to connect to and control supported devices.
