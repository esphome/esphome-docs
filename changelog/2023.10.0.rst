This release is quite small as myself (:ghuser:`jesserockz`) and :ghuser:`kbx81` have been focusing
on ``voice_assistant`` updates and preparations for the Year of the Voice - Chapter 4.

Check out the stream replay here:

XOR Condition
-------------

A new ``xor`` condition has been added to the automation engine. This condition will only be true
when a single condition in the list is true.

Release 2023.10.3 - October 24

Breaking changes
----------------

The SHT3x had a ``heater_enabled`` config option added in the 2023.9.0 release with a default value of ``true``.
This has been flipped this release to be ``false`` as it started causing issues with various sensors.

The SPS30 number concentration sensors had their units fixed to be ``#/cm³`` instead of ``#/m³``.
