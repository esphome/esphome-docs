microWakeWord
-------------

The `micro_wake_word` component has been updated to "version 2".
This brings the capability to configure multiple models per device and has a ``vad`` model for
voice activity detection.

The configuration has a breaking change to support these new features.

.. code-block:: yaml

    micro_wake_word:
      model: okay_nabu

needs to be changed to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    micro_wake_word:
      models:
        - okay_nabu

Please see the :doc:`Documentation </components/micro_wake_word>` for the full configuration.
