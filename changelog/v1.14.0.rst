So... it's been a while since the last release...

But today - november 1 - the wait has finally ended! We're proud to announce ESPHome 1.14,
a release with the most features additions to date thanks to a ton of contributors!

Captive Portal
**************

First, we've heard your feedback in the feature request tracker. One of the highest requested
features has been to add a WiFi captive portal (also called "WiFiManager") capability to ESPHome.

    :width: 60.0%

With the new :doc:`captive portal </components/captive_portal>` component you can set up a fallback
WiFi hotspot that gets created if the ESP fails to connect to the WiFi network. If you're creating
a new device this is automatically enabled. To add this feature existing devices check out the
:doc:`captive portal example </components/captive_portal>`.

VSCode Plugin & New Integrations
********************************

:ghuser:`glmnet` has been very active in the ESPHome community - he not only managed a ton
of bug reports and feature requests, he also implemented some very interesting features:

- ESPHome now has a working VSCode plugin with live config validation support!
  Check out the `ESPHome plugin on the VSCode marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ESPHome.esphome-vscode>`__.
- The new :doc:`SIM800L integration </components/sim800l>` lets you send SMS and
  with :doc:`DF-Player </components/dfplayer>` you can play some music from your ESP 🎵

Thank you :ghuser:`glmnet` for your work!

New Sensors
***********

As you can see in the grid at the top of this page, there's been no shortage of sensors either!
There are all kinds of new sensor types here: from :doc:`lightning detectors ⚡️ </components/sensor/as3935>`,
the laser distance measuring :doc:`vl53l0x </components/sensor/vl53l0x>` to various environmental
sensors (thanks :ghuser:`TheEggi`, :ghuser:`valordk`!).

In list of supported power measuring chips has grown a lot with the 3-channel :doc:`ATM90E32 </components/sensor/atm90e32>`,
various PZEM-004Ts and the power monitoring chip in the :doc:`Shelly 2.5 </components/sensor/ade7953>`
(thanks :ghuser:`thompsa` :ghuser:`tsunglung`!).

Of course there's a lot more features in this release that didn't fit here anymore.
Just to name a few: new Xiaomi BLE devices are supported, the
:doc:`Tuya MCU protocol </components/light/tuya>` (thanks :ghuser:`ssieb` and :ghuser:`brandond`!) has been added and major
architectural parts of the ESPHome native API have changed to allow for faster
development.

Oh, and before we forget: ESPHome has reached 1.000 stars on GitHub!

As always, thanks to all contributors, bug reporters and patrons! Without you this would not
be possible!

Breaking Changes
----------------

- We have deprecated support for Python 2 installs. 1.14.x will still work with Python 2,
  but will print a warning. Starting with 1.15.0, ESPHome will require at least Python 3.6.
  Note: The Docker/Hass.io addon images already use Python 3 (:esphomepr:`784`, :esphomepr:`774`).

- The ``xiaomi_`` BLE platforms have been renamed to match their model numbers (:esphomepr:`755`).

   - ``xiaomi_mijia`` -> :doc:`xiaomi_lywsdcgq </components/sensor/xiaomi_lywsdcgq>`
   - ``xiaomi_miflora`` -> :doc:`xiaomi_hhccjcy01 </components/sensor/xiaomi_hhccjcy01>`

- As part of the addition of the captive portal component, the default ``reboot_timeout`` for
  ``wifi`` has been increased to 15 minutes from the previous 5 minutes (:esphomepr:`624`).

- The ESP32 LEDC ``bit_depth`` option has been removed. The best bit depth is now dynamically
  calculated (:esphomepr:`754`, :doc:`docs </components/output/ledc>`).

- For :doc:`pcf8574 </components/pcf8574>`, the ``INPUT_PULLUP`` option has been removed and replaced
  with ``INPUT`` (:esphomepr:`828`, :doc:`docs </components/pcf8574>`).

Notable Changes & New Features
------------------------------

- Dashboard Interface: Add an "Update all" button (:esphomepr:`615`).
- Uploads over USB are now about 4 times faster (:esphomepr:`761`).
- `ESPHome-Flasher v1.2.0 <https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/tag/v1.2.0>`__ has been
  released with fixes for ESP32s and faster uploads.
- All :doc:`native API </components/api>` communication stubs are now automatically
  generated using automated scripts. This is a big step towards making the API more flexible, for
  example cross-device communication (:esphomepr:`633`).
- New class :apiclass:`CustomAPIDevice` to declare user-defined services straight from custom components.
  See the updated :doc:`custom component guide </custom/custom_component>`.
- :ref:`Sensors <config-sensor>` have a new ``force_update`` option (:esphomepr:`783`).
- Add GPIO Switch :ref:`interlock_wait_time <switch-gpio-interlocking>` (:esphomepr:`777`).
- Add a configurable priority for WiFi network selection (:esphomepr:`658`, :doc:`docs </components/wifi>`).
- Add :ref:`script.wait <script-wait_action>` action (:esphomepr:`778`).
- Dashboard Interface: Add an interface for editing ``secrets.yaml`` (:esphomepr:`672` by :ghuser:`Anonym-tsk`).
- Dashboard Interface: Authorization by username and password for non-Hass.io installs
  (:esphomepr:`668` by :ghuser:`Anonym-tsk`).
- Dashboard Interface: The material icons font is now shipped with ESPHome
  (:esphomepr:`703` by :ghuser:`Anonym-tsk`).
- Add :ref:`output.ledc.set_frequency <output-ledc-set_frequency_action>` action (:esphomepr:`754`).
- Changing from an effect to a static color for addressable light now
  has per-LED transitions (:esphomepr:`750`).
- Add :ref:`rotary_encoder.set_value <sensor-rotary_encoder-set_value_action>` action (:esphomepr:`747`).
- You can now specify per-device descriptions in the dashboard interface
  (:esphomepr:`707` by :ghuser:`Anonym-tsk`, :doc:`docs </components/esphome>`).
- The :doc:`SPI bus </components/spi>` now sends data over the hardware SPI bus if possible.
  This can result in significant speedups for displays (:esphomepr:`623`).
- Add ``delayed_on_off`` binary_sensor filter (:esphomepr:`700` by :ghuser:`kepten`,
  :ref:`docs <sensor-filters>`).
- Implement ``median`` sensor filter (:esphomepr:`697` by :ghuser:`jvanderneutstulen`,
  :ref:`docs <sensor-filters>`).
- A function scheduler now handles all of ESPHome's timeout/interval calls, replacing the
  previous per-component implementation (:esphomepr:`609`).
- Add support for calibrating MH-Z19 sensors (:esphomepr:`683` by :ghuser:`Anonym-tsk`, :doc:`docs </components/sensor/mhz19>`).
- Add BLE scan parameters for improving BLE detection percentage
  (:esphomepr:`769`, :doc:`docs </components/esp32_ble_tracker>`).
- Add configurable ignore bits to rc_switch_raw codes (:esphomepr:`650` by :ghuser:`mtl010957`,
  :doc:`docs </components/remote_receiver>`).
- New ``restore`` option has been added to :doc:`servos </components/servo>` (:esphomepr:`829`).
- Add IR receiver support for coolix climate devices (:esphomepr:`645` by :ghuser:`glmnet`, :doc:`docs </components/climate/climate_ir>`).
- Add :ref:`calibrate_polynomial <sensor-calibrate_polynomial>` sensor filter (:esphomepr:`642`).
- Allow setting the initial mode of HLW8012 sensors (:esphomepr:`611` by :ghuser:`brandond`, :doc:`docs </components/sensor/hlw8012>`).
- Add tilt actions to :doc:`template cover </components/cover/template>` (:esphomepr:`577` by :ghuser:`mtl010957`).
- Add backlight handling for lcd_pcf8574 (:esphomepr:`573` by :ghuser:`adarazs`, :doc:`docs </components/display/lcd_display>`).
