LD2410
------

The LD2410 component has had a massive upgrade thanks to :ghuser:`regevbr`!
It now supports settings most if not all configuration parameters via ``switches`` / ``numbers`` and ``selects``
and exposes more data via various ``sensors``.
This includes breaking changes that mean the existing gate configuration options have been moved to the ``number`` platform.
