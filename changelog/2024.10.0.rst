Web Server Grouping
-------------------

For those that use the :doc:`/components/web_server` with version 3, there is a new
grouping feature that allows for custom/user defined groups of entities.

This is also a breaking change as the previous ``web_server_sorting_weight`` has been moved into a new
``web_server`` -> ``sorting_weight`` configuration entry for the entity.

Please see :ref:`config-webserver-sorting` for the latest documentation on these features.
