Web Server Grouping
-------------------

For those that use the :doc:`/components/web_server` with version 3, there is a new
grouping feature that allows for custom/user defined groups of entities.

This is also a breaking change as the previous ``web_server_sorting_weight`` has been moved into a new
``web_server`` -> ``sorting_weight`` configuration entry for the entity.

Please see :ref:`config-webserver-sorting` for the latest documentation on these features.

ESP32 Advanced MAC Address Configuration
----------------------------------------

ESPHome now supports reading a custom MAC address from the ESP32 eFuse blocks and will read and use it by default if
there is data burned into the eFuses. If you would like to disable this, or the eFuse has data burned that is not a
MAC address into those eFuses, then you can add ``ignore_efuse_custom_mac: true`` to your ESP32 ``advanced``
configuration. See :ref:`ESP32 Advanced Configuration <esp32-advanced_configuration>` for more details.


CSE7766 Breaking Changes
------------------------

The :doc:`/components/sensor/cse7766` now requires even parity in configuration. There are some chips that work without ``EVEN``,
but the majority of newer chips seem to require it and the older ones work fine with it set as well so to make it consistent across all devices
the component now requires it.
