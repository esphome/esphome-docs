We are almost half way through 2022 already! My, how fast time flies when we
are having fun with ESPHome. This release is kind of small, but packs some big features.
There will be no 2022.7.0 (July) release next month as I (:ghuser:`jesserockz`) will be away
around that time. So lets hope we can make 2022.8.0 worth the wait.

ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ Media Players
--------------------

ESPHome can now become a media player target for Home Assistant. This allows users to buy or build
ESP32 based speakers and place them around the house.

We made a small website showing you a few tested `Media Players <https://esphome.github.io/media-players>`_ and you can
install ESPHome directly to them via the browser using ESP Web Tools.

Join us in a live stream all about Audio in the Open Home!

When: Thursday, June 16, at 7pm UTC / 12pm PST / 9pm CET

Includes with vars
------------------

:ghuser:`jimtng` is a newcomer to ESPHome. While migrating everything from a certain other
firmware, they found that they had to duplicate lots of yaml configuration for their many devices.
Basically, they decided to upgrade the ``!include`` yaml "directive" to allow variables.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # device.yaml
    binary_sensor:
      - <<: !include
          file: bin-sensor.yaml
          vars:
            pin: GPIO1
            name: "Binary Sensor 1"
            switch: my_switch_1_id
            delay: 10s
      - <<: !include
          file: bin-sensor.yaml
          vars:
            pin: GPIO1
            name: "Binary Sensor 2"
            switch: my_switch_2_id
            delay: 60s

    # bin-sensor.yaml
    platform: gpio
    pin: ${pin}
    name: ${name}
    on_press:
      - switch.turn_on: ${switch}
      - delay: ${delay}
      - switch.turn_off: ${switch}

Now while this is probably not the best example, the variables act as ``substitutions``
and can be used anywhere in the underlying yaml file and can very much DRY out your configurations.

Breaking Changes
----------------

TCS34725 integration time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sampling settings for the TCS34725 have had a new option ``auto`` added and set as the default. This allows for better accuracy.
You are able to set it back to the previous default value by specifying ``integration_time: 2.4ms`` in your configuration.

SGP40 moved
^^^^^^^^^^^

While adding support for the SGP41 chip, the SGP40 was moved and they were both combined into a new ``sgp4x`` component.

MQTT fan speeds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:esphomepr:`3397` removes deprecated MQTT fan speed state and speed command topics.
These were replaced with speed level state and command topics in ESPHome 2021.10.0.

AC Dimmer
^^^^^^^^^

Due to an output power calculation the perceived power might vary slightly specially in the lower and upper regions.

DisplayBuffer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new virtual method was added to the DisplayBuffer class for specifying the display type. This change only affects ``external_components``.
See :esphomepr:`3430` for more details.
