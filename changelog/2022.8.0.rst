Bluetooth Proxy
---------------

ESPHome 2022.8.2 brings a new feature that allows you to use your ESP32 devices as Bluetooth Proxies for Home Assistant.
They will forward the BLE Advertisements to Home Assistant which will then trigger a discovery and allow you to set up
an integration for the found devices. This allows you to set up multiple ESP32 Bluetooth Proxies around the area to make
sure all advertisements are received reliably.

We have created a few examples that are ready to flash directly from your browser for some specific devices:

Sprinkler controller
--------------------

:ghuser:`kbx81` has written a beast of a sprinkler controller to help organise and schedule all of your sprinkler valves
and keep those plants and veggies thriving. Check out the docs at :doc:`/components/sprinkler`.

ST7789V
-------

The :doc:`/components/display/st7789v` display platform has had an update which adds a ``model`` configuration option.
With this comes custom width and heights to allow you to use this with any display using this driver now.

Breaking Changes
----------------

There are a few breaking changes this release, including removing ``min_save_interval`` from
the :doc:`/components/sensor/integration` and :doc:`/components/sensor/total_daily_energy`.
The BedJet climate introduced recently has also undergone a refactoring to allow different
platforms to extend the functionality available from ESPHome.
