Time Entities
-------------

ESPHome now has support for ``time`` entities that can be set from the frontend (like Home Assistant). THis allows you to set a timer to execute future automations on device.

ESPHome Dates require Home Assistant 2024.4 or later.


Voice Assistant Audio
---------------------

This release adds support for sending and receiving audio to/from voice assistants via the API. Currently ESPHome sends and receives the Voice Assistant audio bytes
via a UDP socket which can be unreliable and insecure. Beginning with Home Assistant 2024.5, both sides will automatically recognise that they both support API Audio and will
use that route instead. This is more reliable because the ESPHome API uses a TCP socket, so packet order and delivery is guaranteed, and if you use API Encryption,
your audio will also be encrypted in transit.
