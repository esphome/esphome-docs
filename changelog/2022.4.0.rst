Home Assistant Addon Repo
-------------------------

This is a repeat from the 2022.2 release notes.

The `ESPHome Home Assistant addon repository <https://github.com/esphome/home-assistant-addon>`__
is added by default to new Home Assistant installations. Because of this, we have decided that we would
deprecate the ESPHome addon inside the `Community Addons <https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository>`__
and everyone should move to the ESPHome repo. It is safe to delete the Community ESPHome addon as
your configuration YAML files are stored in the Home Assistant configuration folder.

You can add the repository here:

.. raw:: html

    <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fesphome%2Fhome-assistant-addon"
       target="_blank">
        <img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg"
             alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled." />
    </a>

And then install the latest ESPHome addon here:

.. raw:: html

    <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=5c53de3b_esphome" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg"
             alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of a Supervisor add-on." />
    </a>

Python 3.8 Minimum
------------------

A friendly reminder that 2022.3 set the minimum Python version to 3.8.
Please upgrade your local python if you are unable to update ESPHome further.
This is taken care of automatically if you are using the Home Assistant Add-on, or the
ESPHome docker container.

Shelly Dimmer 2
---------------

Support for the STM32 chip of the Shelly Dimmer has been added in this release. The component also supports flashing custom firmware to the
stm32 via ESPHome which is required to use the component. See the :doc:`documentation </components/light/shelly_dimmer>` for more details.

Google Fonts
------------

:ghuser:`OttoWinter` has given everyone a way to use Google Fonts in their yaml and displays without having to manually download
ttf font files. The exqample below will automatically download and cache the Roboto ttf font file required so you can utilise it.
See the :ref:`display-static_text` documentation for more details.

.. code-block:: yaml

    font:
      - file: "gfonts://Roboto"
        id: roboto
        size: 20


Deep sleep wakeup time
----------------------

Deep sleep for ESP32 has had a new feature added.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - deep_sleep.enter:
          until: "14:00:00"
          time_id: ...

This will automatically calculate the time required to deep sleep to ensure that the device will
wake up at "14:00:00". The time format here is local time to match the timezone you have configured and
this requires a time component to be configured.


Sensors imported from Home Assistant
------------------------------------

In this release there is a breaking change on the sensors that are imported from homeassistant, ``platform: homeassistant``.
They will now default to being internal to ESPHome and will not be re-exported back to Home Assistant, MQTT or the web server.
This change makes sense as it was just extra sensors and netowkr traffic. You are able to add these back as non internal by
adding ``internal: false`` to the yaml for each of the sensors.
