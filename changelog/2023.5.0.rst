Speakers!!!
-----------

Following on from last months release adding :doc:`microphones </components/microphone/index>`,
this release adds :doc:`speaker </components/speaker/index>` support!

These new changes allows the :doc:`/components/voice_assistant` to request the raw audio
stream response from Home Assistant to playback without using a full :doc:`/components/media_player/index`.
This has much lower latency and allows for a much more responsive voice assistant experience.


More Microphones
----------------

This release also adds a bit more configuration for the i2s_audio microphone components.
There is a breaking-change that requires new configuration fields to be added in YAML.
See the :doc:`microphone documentation </components/microphone/i2s_audio>` for the configuration details,
but below is a small example for the M5Stack Atom Echo.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Old
    microphone:
      platform: i2s_audio
      i2s_din_pin: GPIO23
      id: my_microphone

    # New
    microphone:
      platform: i2s_audio
      i2s_din_pin: GPIO23
      adc_type: external
      pdm: false
