This month we have been busy upgrading the Bluetooth Proxy support for Home Assistant.
This meant there are many PRs awaiting reviews for new components that were unable to be
reviewed and merged in time. We will be trying to pack the next release.

Python Version 3.9
------------------

ESPHome now requires Python 3.9 or newer. This is taken care of if you use the Home Assistant addon
or docker image. If using pip, you will need to upgrade your Python version manually before ESPHome will
upgrade.

BLE Client Sensors
------------------

Due to adding a new RSSI sensor to the ``ble_client`` sensor platform, a new ``type`` configuration variable.
You will get a validation error when you try to install and you have not added a ``type`` to your
existing configurations.

XPT2046 Touchscreen
-------------------

The ``xpt2046`` touchscreen component has been updated to be a platform of ``touchscreen`` instead of a
top level component. This requires a small change to your configuration, see :doc:`/components/touchscreen/xpt2046`
for the new way to configure.
