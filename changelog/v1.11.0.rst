Release 1.11.0 is here, and it has been a busy few weeks :)

First of all, thank you all for the amazing support on discord, twitter, twitch, etc.
Seeing how much people can accomplish with this tool is really inspiring!

ESPHome Rename Completed
------------------------

Back in 1.10.0, it was decided to rename the project from esphomelib to ESPHome. This release
has seen **massive** refactors to allow this rename. Literally thousands of files had
to be changed, often with lots of manual action required. Now a rename might not seem
too exciting for you the user, but consider this: Lots of ancient code got revised and cleaned up,
the ESPHome source got moved to a `dedicated Github Organization <https://github.com/esphome>`__
and many other organizational changes were made which will enable faster feature development.

As an example, ESPHome's documentation now gets built and served by `Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`__,
so all documentation contributions will now get a preview of the changes on a preview website.

Installation Methods Changed
----------------------------

Because of this rename, ESPHome's installation methods have also changed (breaking change!).

- **Hass.io**: The Hass.io addon repository has moved to `https://github.com/esphome/hassio <https://github.com/esphome/hassio>`__,
  please remove the old addon repository and add the new repository.

- **pip-based installs**: The new installation command is ``pip install esphome`` and
  the ``esphomeyaml`` command now is called ``esphome``.

- **docker-based installs**: The docker image has moved to ``esphome/esphome``. So now you need
  to use ``docker run --rm -it esphome/esphome livingroom.yaml run``. The dashboard view
  now uses mDNS to show online/offline status of ESPs, so you need to add ``--net=host`` for
  that to work.

All old installation methods will no longer receive updates (and potentially be removed
in the future).

Local mDNS Responder
--------------------

Up until now, many users had to set static IPs for all ESP nodes in order to be able to connect to
them. That was not a good user experience and this project is committed to providing the best
possible user experience. So now ESPHome bundles its own mDNS responder so static IPs are no
longer necessary (ref: :esphomepr:`386`)! ðŸŽ‰


Faster Release Cycle
--------------------

One of the big things that needs to be changed with this project is the release cycle.
For one thing there's all contributions by you the users that potentially have to wait
before users can use it. But it also makes releasing small tweaks or fixes much more difficult.

I know I've said this before, but I want to move ESPHome to a quicker and more regular release
interval. As a start, I've set my personal due date for the next release to be in two weeks.
Going forward, I want to have a regular release interval of 3 weeks (remind me of this if I forget :)

Also, you might have seen me post a picture of an ESP32 camera integration for ESPHome. Don't worry,
I've made that a top priority for the next release, but I've hit some road blocks that would have
prevented it from working in a stable way for this release (and I needed to finally get this darn
release out).
