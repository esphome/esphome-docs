Light and Versatile Embedded Graphics Library
---------------------------------------------

Or LVGL for short, has been worked on by :ghuser:`clydebarrow` (and multiple other users doing testing and documentation etc)
for quite some time now and is finally ready for releasing this month. It is a very powerful graphics library that
is able to be configured almost completely in YAML (There are some places that will require lambdas/c++).
The :doc:`documentation </components/lvgl/index>` is very extensive and hopefully we see
some awesome dashboards being made with it.

Online Image
------------

:ghuser:`guillempages` created a new :doc:`online_image </components/online_image>` component that allows your ESPHome device to download
images from the internet while it is running and show them on your display. This can also be combined with the new LVGL
component to show dynamic images for your dashboard.

Home Assistant Switch & Number
------------------------------

New platforms have been added for ``switch`` and ``number`` to allow importing of state and controlling
of switches and numbers that exist in Home Assistant (or another device via Home Assistant).
This greatly simplifies controlling remote entities and will hopefully be extended to other platforms.

Thank you for your support
--------------------------

We would like to thank all Home Assistant Cloud subscribers for their support. It allows `Nabu Casa <https://nabucasa.com/>`__ to
employ two developers to maintain and further develop the ESPHome project.
