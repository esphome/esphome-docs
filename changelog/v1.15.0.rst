Stop! this is not Otto Winter, but Guillermo Ruffino (:ghuser:`glmnet`). So Hi there!

Latest feature release was 10 months ago already, however development and support did not stop. We have
lots of contributions here, the list above with integrations images is the longest to date and the changelog
is bigger too!

Notable Changes & New Features
------------------------------

ESPHome add on is now also available at the Home Assistant community add ons!  (:ghuser:`OttoWinter` and
:ghuser:`frenck` of course)

The dashboard got a visual revamp! Now more nodes are visible at the same time. :ghuser:`jonathanadams` also
took a few bugs with it too.

Lots new sensors, port expanders, displays... and :ghuser:`kbx81` came up with color displays too!
There are new climates like the Thermostat, PID and more IR based devices too. And can't wait to see DIY
projects with the RTTTL buzzer.

Scripts are more stable, and also were updated to follow new Home Assistant script options, like ``single``,
``queued``, etc.

Also if you don't like repeating stuff in yaml, the new packages options :ghuser:`corvis` added are very handy.

I did a terrible job tagging contributions and now I'm paying for that, hope nobody gets angry.

I've updated the contributors list in an attepmpt of giving people credit, many really deserve to be listed
here not only for their code contributions but also for their support on the community, bug fixing etc., thanks!

This release is possible not only because all the contributions this project receives, but also for the
latest contributions from Otto itself, he did a great job automating GitHub with actions and also building
scripts which takes cares of 90% of the release process, so hopefully new versions will come along at a better pace.
If you don't see somebody credited by somthing, thats because Otto did it.

From myself special thanks to :ghuser:`ssieb`, :ghuser:`rradar`, :ghuser:`jesserockz`, :ghuser:`kbx81`, and many others
specially :ghuser:`OttoWinter` for all this.

Still many new features and fixes are pending to be included in this release, but we had to left them aside
for a while so we can focus better. So let's ship this and keep going on new stuff!!

Last but not least, thanks to all contributors, bug reporters and patrons! Without you this would not
be possible!
