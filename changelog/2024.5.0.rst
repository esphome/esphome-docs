Valves, Events, and More
------------------------

This release brings a new ``Valve`` component, which can be used to control valves.
A ``Valve`` can be opened, closed, or a specific position set if supported.

``Event`` entities were added to Home Assistant in `2023.8 <https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/08/02/release-20238/#introducing-the-event-entity>`__.
They allow better structure and also history and logging of the events sent from ESPHome to Home Assistant compared to just using publishing events onto the
Home Assistant event bus with the ``homeassistant.event`` action.

The ``datetime`` component has also been extended with ``DateTime`` and ``Time`` entity types this release.


ESP32 ADC Attenuation
---------------------

The attenuation configuration option for ESP32 ``adc`` sensors has had a deprecation in the underlying ESP-IDF framework with the ``11dB`` option.
The value to replace ``11dB`` with is ``12dB``. There are no functionality changes otherwise. There will be a warning in the logs when installing if you
are using ``11dB`` and it will be removed in **2024.8.0**.

Remote Receiver tolerance
-------------------------

The ``tolerance`` option in the ``remote_receiver`` component has been extended to allow time values, but at the same time the validation is now more strict.
If you were using a raw value with no unit before 2024.5.0, for example ``25``, you will need to change it to ``25%``.
