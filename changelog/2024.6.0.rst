An update on updates
--------------------

So we have a few updates to update you on this |ss| update |se| release.
Please do read these release notes carefully as there are quite a few breaking changes that
we know will affect a large portion of users.

Join us for the ESPHome Release Party for the 2024.6.0 release! We'll talk about the hard work put into
ESPHome over the past few months, its new home under the Open Home Foundation, and share with you the new logo!

ESPHome branding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In April, Nabu Casa donated ESPHome to the newly found Open Home Foundation. This foundation,
which also owns Home Assistant, fights for the rights of privacy, choice, and sustainability
of the smart home - and everyone that lives in one. This was done to create a bulwark against
surveillance capitalism, the risk of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware.
To an extent, this protection extends even against our future selvesâ€”so that smart home users
can continue to benefit for years, if not decades, no matter what comes.

As part of this new governance, we decided to align the branding of Home Assistant and ESPHome,
the two consumer-facing projects of the foundation, to communicate that we share a common vision.

This change will not have any impact on the day-to- day running of ESPHome.
Both Keith and I will remain full-time employees at Nabu Casa, a commercial partner of
the Open Home Foundation, to further develop ESPHome as the best way for anyone to create
smart home devices. To support our work,

Update Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, we created ``update`` entities. These are similar to the ones that Home Assistant shows now when
you have the ESPHome Add-on installed in Home Assistant OS, except those ones show you an update to the
version of the ESPHome Add-on and in the background will compile and upload new firmware to your device.

These new ``update`` entities are a bit different. If you have acquired a device that was pre-installed
with ESPHome, the vendor you acquired the device from is now able to compile the firmware and host it
on a website along with a description of the firmware the device can read and present that there is an
update available for this device. You do not need to adopt the device into the ESPHome dashboard, and
you don't actually need the ESPHome dashboard installed. Using the new ``http_request`` OTA platform,
the device will be able to download the firmware and update itself.

.. note::

    Update Entities require at least Home Assistant 2024.7 to show up and be controlled in the Home Assistant UI.

Voice Assistant Timers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Home Assistant 2024.6 added support for starting, pausing, resuming, cancelling timers via Assist devices.
In this ESPHome release, we added new triggers to the :doc:`Voice Assistant </components/voice_assistant>` component
to take advantage of these. Timers are only in memory, do not represent entities and are only available on the device
that started the timer.

OTA Platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the above mentioned ``http_request`` OTA platform, we made the decision to split out the current
``ota`` server to its own platform to make the code more managable and to allow for more flexibility going forward.

Because of this, all configurations that currently have ``ota:`` in them will fail to validate after
updating to this release.

You will need to change the configuration by adding a new line as below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Old
    ota:

    ota:
      password: "xxxx"

    # New
    ota:
      platform: esphome

    ota:
      platform: esphome
      password: "xxxx"

As part of this change also, :doc:`safe_mode </components/safe_mode>` has been pulled out into its own top level component.
It is automatically included in any configuration that has an ``ota`` configuration block, so there is nothing you
need to do unless you were overriding some of the safe mode specific configurations.

1-Wire
^^^^^^

Up until now, the ``dallas`` sensor platform contained the only 1-wire implementation in ESPHome.
There had been requests to add support for other 1-wire based components, so :ghuser:`ssieb` has
made a new top level :doc:`1-wire </components/one_wire>` component that will allow for this.
In doing so, the ``dallas`` sensor platform has been removed, and replaced with ``dallas_temp``
to allow for other Dallas sensors to be implemented that are not temperature sensors.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Old
    dallas:
      - pin: GPIOXX

    sensor:
      - platform: dallas
        address: 0x1234567890abcdef
        name: "My Sensor"

    # New
    one_wire:
      - pin: GPIOXX

    sensor:
      - platform: dallas_temp
        address: 0x1234567890abcdef
        name: "My Sensor"

HTTP(s) Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :doc:`http_request </components/http_request>` platform has been rewritten in this release to
add support when using ESP-IDF or when using the :doc:`rp2040 </components/rp2040>` platform. This will
also allow other ESPHome components to make HTTP(s) requests which includes the new ``http_request`` OTA platform and the
``update`` entities.

As part of this, the configuration has been changed quite a bit so please read the documentation for the latest
configuration options.

JSON parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An internal helper component ``json`` has had some minor, but breaking changes that now require the parsing
callback function to return a boolean value, representing whether the parsing was successful or not.
This is mostly an internal change, but could be used by :doc:`external components </components/external_components>`
or lambdas in YAML.
