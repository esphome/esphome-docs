Since starting monthly cycles, it just made sense to make this release, **ESPHome 2021.8.0**. From now ESPHome will
be versioned according to the year and month of the release. We hope that this will not confuse everyone too much =).

There are a bunch of new integrations this release as seen above and a few breaking changes below. Hopefully nothing
has been missed out.

Also, look at that nice sorted and categorized home page of sensors. Thanks to :ghuser:`patfelst` for doing this.


Select Entities
---------------

ESPHome devices can now create :doc:`Select</components/select/index>` entities in Home Assistant. This allows you to
not have to create ``input_select`` from HA and then import the current option into ESPHome.
The chosen option can be updated from both sides and will be reflected accordinlgy.


Light Color Modes
-----------------

:ghuser:`oxan` has been at it working hard on getting the all of the light code up to scratch and working
really well with the latest changes to Home Assistant. This is mostly an internal change, but ESPHome has
been updated to properly support Home Assistant's color modes for lights. For the most part it mainly
fixes issues that have come up with the color mode on Home Assistant not doing what people expected in ESPHome.


DSMR
----

:ghuser:`glmnet` and :ghuser:`zuidwijk` have worked together to bring DSMR support to ESPHome.
This platform allows you to read your DSMR smart meter via the P1 port. Check out the
`repo <https://github.com/zuidwijk/dsmr>`_ with more info on the hardware required for this.


Thermostat Breaking changes
---------------------------

:ghuser:`kbx81` Has made a few changes to the :doc:`thermostat</components/climate/thermostat>` climate platform
in :esphomepr:`2032`, :esphomepr:`2073` and :esphomepr:`2114` to allow for the many different use cases that everyone has.
Unfortunately this means you might need to make some changes to your YAML configuration to utilize the new code.

 - ``hysteresis`` has been replaced with ``cool_deadband``, ``cool_overrun``, ``heat_deadband`` and ``heat_overrun``.
 - Climate action timers now govern how quickly climate actions may be called:

   - ``min_idle_time`` is required for all configurations.
   - ``min_cooling_off_time`` and  ``min_cooling_run_time`` are required where cool_action or dry_action is used.
   - ``min_heating_off_time`` and ``min_heating_run_time`` are required where heat_action is used.
   - ``min_fanning_off_time`` and ``min_fanning_run_time`` are required where fan_only_action is used.
   - ``min_fan_mode_switching_time`` is required where any ``fan_mode`` actions (ex.: ``fan_mode_auto_action``, ``fan_mode_on_action``) are used.


Anova Souve
-----------

There is a change with the :doc:`Anova BLE Souve</components/climate/anova>` climate platform that has a new **required**
config option: ``unit_of_measurement``.


Home Assistant Add-on
---------------------

For a while there has been an option in the Add-on to allow specifying the ``esphome_version``
which would allow the addon to download a specific version to use. This has been removed
in this release as it causes more issues than it solves. It may be added back to the ``development`` addon
**only** in the future if there is demand, but the stable add-ons should stay stable. If you
need to downgrade the esphome version because a new version does not work the way you expect, then you
should be using the snapshot/backup feature built into Home Assistant Supervisor to rollback.
