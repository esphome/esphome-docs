Rename
------

ESPHome now offers a way for people to rename their devices automatically. This is done by creating a new YAML file with the new
filename, changing the ``name`` inside the YAML, and then OTA uploading to the device to its existing hostname. If all is successful,
the old YAML file will be removed and you can continue configuring your newly named device.

This is particularly useful if you have received a pre-installed device, or are installing pre-configured ESPHome from a website for example.

API Transport Encryption
------------------------

API transport encryption is now enabled by default when you create a new device in ESPHome. This will autogenerate a random encryption key in the device YAML file
that you will need to retrieve when you attempt to add the device to Home Assistant. Simply remove the encryption key lines from your YAML should you choose to not
use encryption.

Select & Number changes
-----------------------

The ``select`` component has had a bunch of new features and actions added.
``select.first``, ``select.last``, ``select.next``, and ``select.previous``.

Alongside these new changes were some removals of internal (but public) functions on ``select`` and ``number`` components that might break
``external_components`` or ``lambdas`` that might have been using them. See :esphomepr:`3457` and :esphomepr:`3458` for more details.
