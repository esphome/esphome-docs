Oh hi there!

It's been a while since the last release (once again 😅). But I hope you'll be excited
to hear what's new in this latest release of ESPHome: 1.13.0!

First of all, as you can see in the table above, a *ton* of new components have been added. Some to
highlight are:

- **Cover Updates**: Covers now support setting arbitrary position (and the new time-based and endstop covers
  make full use of it).
- **Climate Support**: ESPHome now has a full climate abstraction - with the "bang bang" climate device
  you can automate thermostats directly on the ESP.
- **Sun, GPS** etc - This release brings a lot of helper components too of course.

But... the biggest change in this version has yet to be mentioned here: A complete refactor of the
ESPHome codebase. Remember the project rename in 1.11? It's nothing compared to the latest and greatest
`code refactor <https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/504>`__. ESPHome has gotten a completely new
directory structure, and the codebase has been simplified a lot.

**What does this mean for you?**

Well, you'll be happy to hear that this refactor improves **compile times** by around **2x**.
Additionally, these changes will make contributing a lot easier, because now the code is much more
modular.

**But it doesn't stop there!**

This release also brings another awesome new feature: Live validation! If you use the editor in the
ESPHome dashboard, your configuration will be validated on-the-fly and any validation errors
are shown directly in the editor in less than half a second!

I also want to give special shout outs to these awesome people who have contributed a lot of
features in this version:

- :ghuser:`gitolicious` for his awesome work on improving the dashboard!
- :ghuser:`mvturnho` for the new TTP219 and binary sensor map additions!
- :ghuser:`glmnet` for adding the TCL112 and Coolix climate platforms, as well :ghuser:`puuu`
  for pushing ahead with the climate component!
- Everyone who has been supporting me financially over `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/ottowinter>`__!
- Everybody who reported bugs, contributed documentation and fixed things!

If you like this version, please consider starring the `ESPHome repository <https://github.com/esphome/esphome>`__
on Github 💫!

Other notable changes:
----------------------

- Hass.io Ingress - ESPHome now supports showing the dashboard directly in the Home Assistant frontend
  via the Hass.io Ingress feature.
- The i2c variant of the ttp229 device is now also supported.
- Covers now support position & tilt - you can use these with the new :doc:`endstop </components/cover/endstop>`
  and :doc:`time-based </components/cover/time_based>` cover platforms.
- ESPHome has received support for climate devices, you can now let your ESP control heaters/coolers
  directly on the ESP. Great for building a DIY thermostat or making an existing one IoT-enabled.
- :doc:`Lights </components/light/index>` now have some new actions: ``light.dim_relative`` and
  ``light.addressable_set``. Addressable lights now also support a new range syntax (``.range()`` and ``.all()``)
  functions to allow easier effect creation.
- Added a new custom component mechanism and contribution guidelines have been updated. See the
  :doc:`contributing guide </guides/contributing>` for more details.
- :doc:`RDM6300 </components/binary_sensor/rdm6300>` now also has an ``on_tag`` trigger like the PN532.
- :doc:`Remote Transmitter </components/remote_transmitter>` and :doc:`Remote Receiver </components/remote_receiver>`
  have gotten some new features: custom triggers and actions with templatable values.
- Added ``output.esp8266_pwm.set_frequency`` action for dynamically changing the frequency of the ESP8266
  PWM output (for example for active buzzers).
- Added ``servo.detach`` action to disable a servo - this prevents it from moving around once it's in position.
- Added ``stepper.set_speed`` to dynamically change a stepper's speed at runtime.
- Added ``text_sensor.state`` condition for checking a text sensor's state against a fixed value.
- Added :ref:`globals.set <globals-set_action>` action,
  :ref:`script.is_running <script-is_running_condition>` condition,
  :ref:`for <for_condition>` condition.
- Custom components can now access ESPHome's global variables.
- Added ``restore_mode`` for lights and :ref:`light.is_on/off <light-is_on_condition>`.

Breaking Changes
----------------

All of these are also documented in validation - just view the validation output and it should tell
you what has changed.

- ``esphome_core_version`` has been removed - ESPHome is no longer split up in the core and python repository.
- The ``esp32_ble_tracker`` binary sensor platform (not the global hub) has been renamed to ``ble_presence``.
- The remote transmitter switch has been removed and a template switch with the new actions should be used.
  See validation output.
- ``esphome_core_version`` has been removed - ESPHome is no longer split up in the core and python repository.
- Because of some internal changes, some ID names are used internally and can no longer be used.
  See validation errors.
