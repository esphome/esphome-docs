Dates
-----

ESPHome now has support for ``date`` entities that can be set from the frontend (like Home Assistant) for you to check against and execute
automations in the future.

ESPHome Dates require Home Assistant 2024.4 or later.


IPv6
----

ESPHome is now prepared for the future! The future that is the old IPv6 that is.
Dualstack is added and it could now have up to 5 ip addresses of any type, and communication with Home assistant,
MQTT and NTP works with IPv6. ESPHome still depends on IPv4, but the crystal ball shows sign of IPv6-only networks.

If you are building an :doc:`/components/external_components` or you use
``network::get_ip_address()``, ``wifi::global_wifi_component->get_ip_address()`` or ``ethernet::global_eth_component->get_ip_address()``,
these functions have been renamed to ``::get_ip_addresses()`` respectively and now return a list of all IP addresses.
