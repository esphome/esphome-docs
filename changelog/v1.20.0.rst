Number Entities
---------------

Creating ``number`` entities in Home Assistant from ESPHome is now supported. This basically replaces
creating an ``input_number`` and then importing that sensor into ESPHome as a sensor with
``platform: homeassistant``. The state of the number can also be updated directly on the ESPHome device
and will be reflected in Home Assistant.

I would like to see what other platforms people can come up with for the number component,
I have a few ideas myself.


Light Changes
-------------

Unfortunately, some breaking changes had to be made:

- For addressable RGBW lights, the brightness now also applies to the white channel (this was already the case for
  non-addressable RGBW lights). If you want to control only the brightness of the color channel, use the new ``color_brightness`` option.
- For RGBW lights, the white channel is no longer normalized by the color intensity in the ``light.turn_on`` and
  ``light.control`` actions. In previous versions, if the red value was set to 60% and the white value to 30%, this
  would result in the white channel being at 50% brightness. Starting with this version, this will result in the
  white channel being set to 30%, as expected.
