Light platform changes
----------------------

add intro about new features (hopefully we get support for the HA 2021.5 color modes done in time)

Unfortunately, some breaking changes had to be made:

* For addressable RGBW lights, the brightness now also applies to the white channel (this was already the case for
  non-addressable RGBW lights). If you want to control only the brightness of the color channel, use the new
  ``color_brightness`` option.
* For RGBW lights, the white channel is no longer normalized by the color intensity in the ``light.turn_on`` and
  ``light.control`` actions. In previous versions, if the red value was set to 60% and the white value to 30%, this
  would result in the white channel being at 50% brightness. Starting with this version, this will result in the
  white channel being set to 30%, as expected.
