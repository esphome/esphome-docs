Text Components
---------------

We finally have implemented the :doc:`Text </components/text/index>` Components.
Many people have been using "Text Input Helpers" to get user entered text into
ESPHome for various reasons. Now ESPHome can expose text entities
directly to Home Assistant. These require Home Assistant 2023.11 or above to use.

Various Automations
-------------------

- BLE have had ``ble.enable`` and ``ble.disable`` actions added to turn on and off when not needed,
  as well as a new condition ``ble.enabled`` to check the state.

- Wi-Fi has new triggers for ``on_connect`` and ``on_disconnect``.

- ``api`` has new triggers ``on_client_connected`` and ``on_client_disconnected`` which were
  released in the 2023.10.5 patch version due to requiring that specific PR to not cause merge
  conflicts later.


Areas
-----

When you add a new ESPHome device to Home Assistant, you assign that device to an area.
From Home Assistant 2023.12, you will be able to specify the suggested area that Home Assistant
pre-populates when you connect the device.
