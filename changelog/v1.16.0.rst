Hello, hello. Jesse Hills (:ghuser:`jesserockz`) here. Yet another new name doing the next release.

Hopefully from this point forward, we are looking at releasing monthly on the first Wednesday of each month,
we got the idea from Home Assistant! Thanks guys!

There are a few new components in this release, but there was a lot of bugfixing and improvements overall and
we have a lot of PRs to go through for new features for next months release.

Thank you to all contributors, bug reporters and patrons! Without you this project would not be possible!

Until next month.
