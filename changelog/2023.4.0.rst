Voice Assistant
---------------

This year is the Year of the Voice for Home Assistant, and ESPHome is charging ahead with this in mind.
We've added a new :doc:`/components/voice_assistant` component that allows you to use ESPHome devices as an input
for `assist <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/assist/>`__ in Home Assistant **2023.5 or later**.

With this also comes preliminary :doc:`microphone </components/microphone/index>` support, which has been built in a way that multiple
components, like ``voice_assistant`` can request start / stop of the microphone and get the data. We
hope this leads to more interesting use cases for the microphone in the future.

Home Assistant is hosting a live stream all about the Year of the Voice - Chapter 2.

Keith joins Nabu Casa
---------------------

Nabu Casa is pleased to announce that long time contributor Keith Burzinski (:ghuser:`kbx81`) is joining the
team as a full time developer to help out on ESPHome. Keith created the :doc:`/components/sprinkler`,
:doc:`/components/climate/thermostat`, a bunch of the ``ssd`` display components and a few other components
as well as fixing many bug along the way. I expect his house climate and garden area are kept well in line.

Looking forward to working with you Keith.

Breaking Changes
----------------

IÂ²S Media Player
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the introduction of the :doc:`/components/microphone/i2s_audio`, the media player platform has some
required breaking changes to the YAML configuration. This involves moving the ``i2s_lrclk_pin`` and
``i2s_bclk_pin`` to a new :doc:`/components/i2s_audio` component.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Before
    media_player:
      - platform: i2s_audio
        name: ESPHome I2S Media Player
        dac_type: external
        i2s_lrclk_pin: GPIO33
        i2s_bclk_pin: GPIO19
        i2s_dout_pin: GPIO22
        mode: mono

    # After
    i2s_audio:
      i2s_lrclk_pin: GPIO33
      i2s_bclk_pin: GPIO19

    media_player:
      - platform: i2s_audio
        name: ESPHome I2S Media Player
        dac_type: external
        i2s_dout_pin: GPIO22
        mode: mono

Default restore mode for Switches, Fans and Lights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default ``restore_mode`` for switches, fans and lights has been changed
from ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_OFF`` to ``ALWAYS_OFF`` with the intention that restoring values
from flash should be manually specified by a user if desired in their YAML configuration.

Number ``step``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``number`` components have always internally set a ``step`` required in config,
but allowed it to be not specified at all. This caused issues on the Home Assistant side
of things. This is only a breaking change for external components that have a ``number`` platform.

UART ids
^^^^^^^^

Due to ``uart0`` / ``uart1`` / ``uart2`` being defined in some of the platform code ESPHome uses,
ESPHome will now disallow these ids from being used in the config. You can simply change them to
``uart_0`` to continue using.
