So, ESPHome was acquired by Nabu Casa. That was big and unexpected, but awesome news for the project as now I have been hired
by Nabu Casa full-time to work on ESPHome. I know I said this in the last release, but hopefully now that it is literally
my job, the releases will move to a (yet to be defined) schedule.

A lot of fixes and updates to existing components in this release, and a couple of new integrations and features too. Check them out
if you have the hardware but could not use it before.

Hopefully I can get some help and pointers from the Nabu Casa team to tidy up these release notes and make them all fancy and
actually something to look forward to reading.
