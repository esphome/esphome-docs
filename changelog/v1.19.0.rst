Wow. Ok, so this release may not look big, but there are a number of new features that are not new components.

Improv
------

:doc:`Improv Wi-Fi </components/esp32_improv>` is a new standard that stands for **Improved Provisioning of Wi-Fi
Credentials**. What it does is allow you to provision Wi-Fi credentials to the device by using Bluetooth LE.
Check out the website for more details at `improv-wifi.com <https://www.improv-wifi.com/>`__.


Home Assistant Sensor Attributes
--------------------------------

For a long time now one of the top requested features was to be able to read attributes from Home Assistant
entities into a local sensor in ESPHome. For example the brightness of a light, or the current temperature
of a climate device. :ghuser:`frenck` decided to take a stab and as long as you are running at least ESPHome
1.19.0 and Home Assistant 2021.6 then you can do this. Thanks Frenck!

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        id: current_temperature
        entity_id: climate.living_room
        attribute: current_temperature

For the Creators
----------------

There have been a few additions to the ESPHome codebase that make it easier for creators to make projects
in ESPHome and distribute them pre-installed and ready to use. See the :doc:`new page here </guides/creators>`.


The Web Experience
------------------

We have been working hard on some new tooling to make it easier for everyone to install ESPHome and other DIY
firmwares onto their ESP-based devices. To do this we have created the
`ESP Web Tools <https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/>`__. Big shoutout to :ghuser:`balloob` on most of that work!

Because of these new tools, the ESPHome dashboard has gotten a slight makeover when you choose to install to a device.
You are now given the option to install directly via WebSerial to the ESP from the browser. No more plugging into the
server/VM running ESPHome and restarting container etc. It just works. (Provided you are using Chrome or Edge).

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Thanks to :ghuser:`oxan` for making some change to the ESPHome CLI. Instead of ``esphome config.yaml run``
we now have ``esphome run config.yaml``. The old format is still accepted and will be removed in a future release,
but there is a **breaking change** with this release which is the arguments ``--upload-port`` and ``--serial-port`` have been
combined and changed to ``--device``.
