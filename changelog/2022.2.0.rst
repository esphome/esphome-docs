Home Assistant Addon Repo
-------------------------

In a future Supervisor version, the `ESPHome Home Assistant addon repository <https://github.com/esphome/home-assistant-addon>`__
will be added by default to new Home Assistant installations.
We have decided that we will deprecate the ESPHome addon inside the
`Community Addons <https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository>`__
and everyone should move to the ESPHome repo. It is safe to delete the
ESPHome addon as your configuration YAML files are stored in the Home
Assistant configuration folder.

You can add the ESPHome addon here:

Locks
-----

Lock Entities have been added to ESPHome. These will be available after Home Assistant 2022.3 is released. Thanks :ghuser:`kbickar`.

ESP8266 recommended framework bump
----------------------------------

The recommended (and therefore default) version of Arduino for ESP8266 devices
has been bumped to 3.0.2 from 2.7.4. This brings many underlying changes to the
ESP8266 SDK. The 3.0.2 release has been out since July 2021 but ESPHome just
did not bump the default until now.


FastLED
-------

Due to the Arduino bump, the FastLED library suffers issues when running on ESP8266
on Arduino 3+. Because of this there is now a restriction on the ``fastled_clockless``
and ``fastled_spi`` components to only allow using them if you change the arduino version
back to 2.7.4 or lower. This will be in place until the library can update and fix the
issues. See the :doc:`documentation </components/light/fastled>` for information on how
to continue using the lights.


Improv serial Wi-Fi scan
------------------------

Improv serial has been updated to be able to start a Wi-Fi scan and send the results
back to the improv client so the user can select the network SSID instead of having to type it in.


Tuya Multi multi-datapoint
--------------------------

Some work was done on the tuya component to support devices that send all of their
datapoints in a single message. This allows for more devices to be supported and should
not cause issues with existing devices but please create an issue if it does.


Debug Sensors Breaking change
-----------------------------

The sub-sensors of the ``debug`` have been moved to their respective component platforms.
Please see the :doc:`documentation </components/debug>` page for the new way to configure them.
