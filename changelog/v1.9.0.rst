It's time for another release of esphomelib: 1.9.0. This release is quite different from the last one,
it doesn't focus that much on new integrations with a "modest" amount of 7 new integrations. No, most of the
development has been focused on improving the core architecture and making the esphomelib ecosystem easier to use.
Because that's my main goal of this project: Providing a great user-experience so that you can focus on building
awesome things with DIY hardware!

The features I'm particularly excited about are:

* :ref:`esphomeflasher <esphome-flasher>` - Experiencing problems flashing esphomelib firmwares using esphomeyaml?
  No problem, esphomeflasher is a tool designed to make that super easy. Just let esphomeyaml generate the binary and flash
  from your PC.
* :doc:`Over-the-Air Updates </components/ota>` have been completely re-written to make them a lot more
  stable.
* A lot of work has been put in to provide more context in YAML validation errors. Sometimes, esphomeyaml will even
  try to give you suggestions for how to fix a validation error!
* A new release cycle: esphomeyaml now also has a :ref:`beta release channel <faq-beta>` kind of like Home Assistant. This helps to
  iron out the most important bugs before each stable release
* And of course, lots of stability improvements and bug fixes :)

Thank you very much to everybody who contributed to this release with new code or by
:ref:`reporting bugs <faq-bug_report>`!

New Components
--------------

- There's a new base component called :doc:`text sensors </components/text_sensor/index>` for using
  text-based inputs, not just numbers like the generic :doc:`sensors </components/sensor/index>` did
  (:yamlpr:`166`, :docspr:`52`)

- The new MQTT Subscribe Sensors allow you to get external data into esphomelib's ecosystem via MQTT
  (:libpr:`193`, :yamlpr:`175`, :docspr:`50`)

- Added :doc:`CSE7766 Power Sensor </components/sensor/cse7766>` to support power measurements
  on the Sonoff Pow R2 (:libpr:`277`, :yamlpr:`190`, :docspr:`59`)

- Thanks to :ghuser:`puuu`, the LED driver in the Sonoff B1 (MY9231) is now supported!
  (:libpr:`266`, :yamlpr:`227`, :docspr:`80`)

- Added the :doc:`PMSX003 Particulate Matter Sensor </components/sensor/pmsx003>`
  (:libpr:`229`, :yamlpr:`192`, :docspr:`58`)

- Added support for :doc:`A4988 Stepper Motors </components/stepper/index>` (:libpr:`239`,
  :yamlpr:`206`, :docspr:`68`)

- Added :doc:`total daily energy sensor </components/sensor/total_daily_energy>` to accumulate the total
  power usage over one day (:libpr:`256`, :yamlpr:`220`)

New Features
------------

- Compiling for ESP32s is now possible on RPis ðŸŽ‰

- esphomelib now has a new tool: `esphomeflasher <https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher>`__ to simplify
  flashing on Windows/MacOS machines **without having to install esphomeyaml**. So if esphomeyaml for some reason
  can't find your USB port, you now can use the esphomeflasher app. See :ref:`esphome-flasher`.

- ESP8266s now save the states of lights/switches/... internally and restores them on boot.
  Additionally, esphomelib can now operate in fully offline mode if your WiFi network goes down
  or the MQTT broker is unreachable, see :ref:`automation-networkless`
  (:libpr:`258`, :libpr:`267`, :yamlpr:`229`)

- The :doc:`Over-the-Air Update </components/ota>` process was quite buggy sometimes and the Arduino-library
  esphomelib used was doing some weird stuff. The OTA-process has now been completely re-written to be more stable
  (:libpr:`204`, :yamlpr:`177`).

- Add support for the Home Assistant device registry. If you're using `Home Assistant 0.81.0 <https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/10/26/release-81/>`__
  or higher you will see a list of all components for each esphomelib node in the integrations screen
  (:libpr:`233`).

- The current esphomelib version and compilation time are now printed on each boot
  (:libpr:`189`, :yamlpr:`159`):

  .. code-block:: text

      [13:57:33][I][application:092]: You're running esphomelib v1.9.0 compiled on Nov  3 2018, 13:55:11

- Stack traces in the USB logs are now automatically decoded to make debugging easier
  (:yamlpr:`214`)

- Added :ref:`mqtt-on_json_message` and :ref:`mqtt-publish_json_action` to make using JSON for MQTT payloads easier
  (:libpr:`230`, :yamlpr:`193`, :docspr:`60`)

- The remote (IR) components have received support for Samsung's IR protocol
  (:yamlpr:`176`, :docspr:`48`)

- Added :ref:`component-update_action`, :ref:`logger-log_action` and :ref:`script-execute_action` for simplifying
  automations
  (:libpr:`232`, :yamlpr:`196`, :yamlpr:`198`, :docspr:`61`, :docspr:`63`)

- Added :ref:`binary_sensor-on_multi_click` trigger to distinguish between double, long, and single clicks.
  (:libpr:`262`, :docspr:`77`,  :yamlpr:`226`)

- Added an :ref:`pn532-on_tag` to :doc:`PN532 NFC Readers </components/binary_sensor/pn532>` so that automations
  can directly use the NFC tag ID
  (:libpr:`194`, :yamlpr:`189`, :docspr:`57`)

- Added a ``hass-config`` command which generates a Home Assistant configuration for your esphomeyaml nodes.
  Useful if you're not using MQTT discovery (:yamlpr:`208`)

- All documentation pages now have comment systems powered by `disqus <https://disqus.com/>`__
  (:docspr:`47`)

- You now have to option to have a different log level for log messages sent over MQTT (:ref:`docs <mqtt-message>`,
  :yamlpr:`167`, :docspr:`51`)

- Added a color correction option to :doc:`FastLED addressable lights </components/light/fastled>`
  (:libpr:`234`, :yamlpr:`200`, :docspr:`64`)

- Added a ``clean`` command to esphomeyaml to fix some occasional build errors
  (:yamlpr:`181`)

- Added a ``send_first_at`` option to sliding window moving average sensor filters
  (:libpr:`240`, :yamlpr:`207`, :docspr:`69`)

- You can now upload OTA firmware files with the :doc:`web server component </components/web_server>`

- Added the ability to define global variables in esphomeyaml: :ref:`config-globals`.

- Added a ``frequency`` option to the :doc:`/components/output/esp8266_pwm`.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- As part of the rewrite of Over-The-Air updates, the old OTA protocol is incompatible with the new one -
  But fear not, esphomeyaml still supports the legacy OTA update process. On your first OTA upload with 1.9.0, you will
  see esphomeyaml try with the new OTA method and fail. After that, esphomeyaml will fall back to the old OTA
  process and upload correctly (:libpr:`204`).

- esphomelib's naming convention has been made more consistent. If you're not using any :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`,
  everything will still work. However, if you're using the C++ API, there are a couple of breaking changes:

  For sensors and binary sensors, ``id(my_sensor).value`` has been deprecated and ``id(my_sensor).state`` should be used
  instead. Additionally, the syntax for toggling lights and switches through C++ has been changed. Please see
  the :docspr:`62` changeset for more information
  (:libpr:`231`, :docspr:`62`, :yamlpr:`197`)
