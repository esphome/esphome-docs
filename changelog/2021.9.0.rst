`Home Assistant Amber <https://home-assistant.io/amber>`__
----------------------------------------------------------

You get the most out of your ESPHome devices when you combine it with Home Assistant,
which offers a seamless and local integration to control and manage all your ESPHome devices.
Today Home Assistant launched a crowdfunding campaign for the `Home Assistant Amber <https://home-assistant.io/amber>`__,
the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant and a privacy focused smart home.

API Encryption
--------------

:ghuser:`OttoWinter` has been hard at work adding a layer of encryption to the API which utilises the
``noise`` protocol. This releases adds the capabilities to ESPHome devices, but Home Assistant (or other clients)
will need to upgrade their client libraries (e.g. ``aioesphomeapi``) before they can connect and communicate to
devices with encryption. This is scheduled to be available in Home Assistant 2021.10.

Git Packages
------------

:ref:`Packages<config-git_packages>` have been extended to allow loading (multiple) YAML file(s) from a git repo.
Take a look at the examples to see how to use them.

Midea AC
--------

``platform: midea_ac`` has been changed to ``platform: midea`` in this release and has
quite a few upgrades. Check the docs for the new features. :doc:`/components/climate/midea`

SDM Meters
----------

:doc:`SDM Meters</components/sensor/sdm_meter>` have been fixed to use kWh instead of Wh
as the energy unit of measurement.

Template Select/Number/Switch
-----------------------------

The template selects, numbers and switches now have more validations on them preventing weird usage.
If you do not set a ``lambda`` then you are required to make them either ``optimistic: true``, or
utilise the ``set_action`` (select/number) / ``turn_on_trigger`` (switch).
