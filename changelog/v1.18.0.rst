It feels like I was just writing the release notes for 1.17 not long ago, so here's to getting ESPHome going on a regular schedule.

Releases will be set for the 3rd Wednesday of each month, with a beta release starting 1 week earlier for those who would like to test
that and help make sure it is stable.

Apart from a few new sensors, we now have built in support for :doc:`/components/external_components`, check it out. Thanks :ghuser:`OttoWinter` and :ghuser:`glmnet`

Also now, an ESPHome device is able to connect to other BLE devices and become a :doc:`/components/ble_client`, reading sensors and controlling switches etc.
You can read basic sensor values using the :doc:`/components/sensor/ble_client` component or use the data displayed in the logs to build a new native component
that provides the sensors/switches/etc directly.
