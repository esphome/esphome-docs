micro Wake Word
---------------

ESPHome implements an on-device wake word detection framework from `microWakeWord <https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord>`__.
See the :doc:`component documentation </components/micro_wake_word>` for details on how to use it.

Check out the live stream replay below for more details about how it works and came to be.

BME280 changes
--------------

:ghuser:`apbodrov` has added support for the BME280 sensor over SPI. This change is a breaking change for any existing configurations using
the BME280 over I2C as the platform name has been changed from ``bme280`` to ``bme280_i2c``. There are no other configuration changes required
to continue using the BME280 over I2C. See the :doc:`component documentation </components/sensor/bme280>` for the latest configuration variables.


CSE7766 changes
---------------

:ghuser:`ssieb` has changed the CSE7766 sensor from appearing to be a polling component.
It has a high update rate, so if you don't want to send a lot of data to HA, you can
add the :ref:`throttle_average <sensor-filters>` filter
with the time period you were using for the update interval (the default is 60s) to each
sensor.  The example in the sensor doc page has been updated to show this.
