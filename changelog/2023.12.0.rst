Graphical Menu
--------------

Following on from the previous :doc:`/components/display_menu/lcd_menu` that was only for LCD displays,
there is now a new :doc:`/components/display_menu/graphical_display_menu` that can be used with any
graphical/pixel based display.

Pin Reuse validation
--------------------

There is a new validation performed on configurations to ensure that pins are not reused unintentionally.
This is a common source of issues and generally a pin does not need to be reused across multiple components
in a single configuration. Pins should only be reused in a very limited set of circumstances and seeing the
error will generally mean that you need to reorganise your configuration to not reuse the pins.
The error can be bypassed by specifically adding another config item to all of the
duplicate pin definitions. See the :ref:`config-pin_schema` for details.

Touchscreen internal changes
----------------------------

The touchscreen compoenent code has had a big overhaul which breaks any external components or open PRs for
new touchscreens. See :esphomepr:`4596` for details if this affects you.

MCP3008 breaking changes
------------------------

The MCP3008 has has a restructure of the code and at the same time the default update interval has been changed to 60 seconds,
the units, device class and state class default have also been set to sane defaults expected for a voltage sensor.
