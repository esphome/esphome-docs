UDP & StatsD Components
-----------------------

This release brings two new data driven components to ESPHome.

The first is the :doc:`UDP Component </components/udp>` which allows direct communication between ESPHome
devices over the local network. To start off, only sensor and binary sensor data can be transmitted, and
hopefully more entity types will be supported in the future.

Next is the :doc:`StatsD Component </components/statsd>` which allows you to send sensor data
directly to a statsd server for monitoring.


Breaking Changes
----------------

There are a few breaking changes this release that will require changes in YAML if you are
using the affected components. Please make sure to check the list below for details about each one.
The documentation is always the best place to find the most up-to-date information on configuration for
any given component found in ESPHome.


Thank you for your support
--------------------------

Did you know that Jesse and Keith both are employed at `Nabu Casa <https://nabucasa.com/>`__ to work full-time on ESPHome?
Yep, that's possible thanks to everyone who subscribes to Home Assistant Cloud. Thank you!
