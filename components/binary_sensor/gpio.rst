GPIO Binary Sensor

The GPIO Binary Sensor platform allows you to use any input pin on your
device as a binary sensor.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: D2
        name: "Living Room Window"
        device_class: window

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin to periodically check.
- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the binary sensor.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Binary Sensor <config-binary_sensor>`.

Activating internal pullups
---------------------------

If you're hooking up a button without an external pullup or see lots of ON/OFF events
in the log output all the time, this often means the GPIO pin is floating.

For these cases you need to manually enable the pull-up (or pull-down) resistors on the ESP,
you can do so with the :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin:
          number: D2
          mode:
            input: true
            pullup: true
        name: ...

Inverting Values
----------------

Use the ``inverted`` property of the :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>` to invert the binary
sensor:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin:
          number: D2
          inverted: true
        name: ...

Debouncing Values
-----------------

Some binary sensors are a bit unstable and quickly transition between the ON and OFF state while
they're pressed. To fix this and debounce the signal, use the :ref:`binary sensor filters <binary_sensor-filters>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: D2
        name: ...
        filters:
          - delayed_on: 10ms

Above example will only make the signal go high if the button has stayed high for more than 10ms.
Alternatively, below configuration will make the binary sensor publish an ON value immediately, but
will wait 10ms before publishing an OFF value:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: D2
        name: ...
        filters:
          - delayed_off: 10ms
