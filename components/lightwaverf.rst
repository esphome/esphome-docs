The ``LightWaveRF`` light platform creates a module to dump and send commands to light switches

LightwaveRF switches are very common in UK automation. They allow control of lights, sockets, relays and more via RF remote or via a hub.
Using an inexpensive RF transmitter and receiver you can control your devices via ESPHome.



.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry

    # Specify the two pins to connect the receiver and transmitter
    lightwaverf:
      read_pin: 13
      write_pin: 14

    # Create a switch to trigger a light
    switch:
      - platform: template
        name: "Turn off sofa"
        id: light_off_ceiling_sofa
        turn_on_action:
          lightwaverf.send_raw:
            code:  [0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x03, 0x0d, 0x09, 0x08, 0x08]
            name: "Sofa"
            repeat: 1


Note: To gather the RAW codes from the remote, setup the ``read_pin`` and observe in the logs the printing of the codes.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **read_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin that the receiver is connected to
- **write_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): the pin that the transmitter is connected to


.. lightwaverf.send_raw:


``lightwaverf.send_raw`` Action
--------------------------------

Send the raw data that has been captured via the dump system

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - lightwaverf.send_raw:
            code:  [0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x03, 0x0d, 0x09, 0x08, 0x08]
            name: "Sofa"
            repeat: 1

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (*Optional*, string): The name to give for the action
- **code** (**Required**, list hex): The raw dump in an array of hex
- **repeat** (*Optional*, int): The number of times the message will be repeated
- **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): Send the signal inverted
