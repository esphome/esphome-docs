Exposure Notification Listener

    :description: Instructions for setting up exposure notification listeners for ESPHome.
    :image: exposure_notifications.png

The ``exposure_notifications`` component uses the :doc:`/components/esp32_ble_tracker` to discover
nearby COVID-19 exposure notification bluetooth messages sent by phones running the
`Google/Apple Exposure Notification service <https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/>`__.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esp32_ble_tracker:

    exposure_notifications:
      on_exposure_notification:
        then:
          - lambda: |
              ESP_LOGD("main", "Got notification:");
              ESP_LOGD("main", "  RPI: %s", format_hex_pretty(x.rolling_proximity_identifier).c_str());
              ESP_LOGD("main", "  RSSI: %d", x.rssi);

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **on_exposure_notification** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation
  to run when an exposure notification bluetooth message is received.

  A variable ``x`` of type :apistruct:`exposure_notifications::ExposureNotification` is passed to the automation.

An exposure notification payload contains:

  - Rolling proximity identifier (RPI): A 16-byte long value used to identify a given device in a 10-minute window.
  - Associated encrypted metadata (AEM): Additional encrypted metadata, like transmit power.

Because the GAEN framework is designed to prevent tracking an individual, this data can essentially
only be used to check whether a device with enabled exposure notifications is nearby (and to limited degree
also count them).

Indicator of device with exposure notifications
-----------------------------------------------

The following configuration can be used as an indicator whether an exposure-notifications
enabled device is nearby. As long as an exposure notification has been received in the last
minute, the indicator will be on.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

    switch:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIOXX
        id: led

    script:
      - id: start_led
        then:
          - switch.turn_on: led
          - delay: 1min
          - switch.turn_off: led

    exposure_notifications:
      on_exposure_notification:
        then:
          - lambda: |
              ESP_LOGD("main", "Got notification:");
              ESP_LOGD("main", "  RPI: %s", format_hex_pretty(x.rolling_proximity_identifier).c_str());
              ESP_LOGD("main", "  RSSI: %d", x.rssi);

          # Stop existing timer so that turn_off doesn't get called
          - script.stop: start_led
          - script.execute: start_led
