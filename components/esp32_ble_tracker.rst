    :description: Instructions for setting up ESP32 bluetooth low energy device trackers using ESPHome.
    :image: bluetooth.svg

The ``esp32_ble_tracker`` component creates a global hub so that you can track bluetooth low energy devices
using your ESP32 node.

See :ref:`Setting up devices <esp32_ble_tracker-setting_up_devices>` for information on how you can determine
the MAC address of a device and track it using ESPHome.

.. warning::

    The BLE software stack on the ESP32 consumes a significant amount of RAM on the device.
    
    **Crashes are likely to occur** if you include too many additional components in your device's
    configuration. Memory-intensive components such as :doc:`/components/voice_assistant` and other
    audio components are most likely to cause issues.

.. note::

    The first time this component is enabled for an ESP32, the code partition needs to be
    resized. Please flash the ESP32 via USB when adding this to your configuration. After that,
    you can use OTA updates again.

.. _config-esp32_ble_tracker:

Configuration variables:
------------------------


- **scan_parameters** (*Optional*): Advanced parameters for configuring the scan behavior of the ESP32.
  See also `this guide by Texas Instruments <https://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore/content/simplelink_academy_cc2640r2sdk_5_10_02_00/modules/blestack/ble_scan_adv_basic/ble_scan_adv_basic.html#scanning-basics>`__
  for reference.

  - **interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval between each consecutive scan window.
    This is the time the ESP spends on each of the 3 BLE advertising channels.
    Defaults to ``320ms``.
  - **window** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The time the ESP is actively listening for packets
    on a channel during each scan interval. If this is close to the ``interval`` value, the ESP will
    spend more time listening to packets (but also consume more power). Defaults to ``30ms``
  - **duration** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The duration of each complete scan. This has no real
    impact on the device but can be used to debug the BLE stack. Defaults to ``5min``.
  - **active** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to actively send scan requests to request more data
    after having received an advertising packet. With some devices this is necessary to receive all data,
    but also drains those devices' power a bit more. Some devices don't need this, in that case
    you can save power and RF pollution by setting it to ``false``. Defaults to ``true``.
  - **continuous** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to scan continuously (forever) or to only scan when
    asked to start a scan (with start_scan action). Defaults to ``true``.

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID for this ESP32 BLE Hub.

Automations:

- **on_ble_advertise** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when a Bluetooth advertising is received. See :ref:`esp32_ble_tracker-on_ble_advertise`.
- **on_ble_manufacturer_data_advertise** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to
  perform when a Bluetooth advertising with manufacturer data is received. See
  :ref:`esp32_ble_tracker-on_ble_manufacturer_data_advertise`.
- **on_ble_service_data_advertise** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to
  perform when a Bluetooth advertising with service data is received. See
  :ref:`esp32_ble_tracker-on_ble_service_data_advertise`.
- **on_scan_end** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform when
  a BLE scan has completed (the duration of the scan). This works with continuous set to true or false.

with continuous set to true, this will trigger every time the scan completes (the duration of
a scan).

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:
      on_scan_end:
        - then:

``esp32_ble_tracker.start_scan`` Action
************************************************

Start a Bluetooth scan. If there is a scan already in progress, then the action is ignored.

- **continuous** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to start the scan in continuous mode. Defaults to ``false``

.. note::

    This action can also be written in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:
.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:
      id: ble_tracker_id

.. code-block:: cpp

    id(ble_tracker_id).start_scan()

``esp32_ble_tracker.stop_scan`` Action
************************************************

Stops the bluetooth scanning. It can be started again with the above start scan action.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

    on_...:
      - esp32_ble_tracker.stop_scan:

Use on single-core chips
------------------------

On dual-core devices the WiFi component runs on core 1, while this component runs on core 0.
When using this component on single core chips such as the ESP32-C3 both WiFi and ``ble_tracker`` must run on
the same core, and this has been known to cause issues when connecting to WiFi. A work-around for this is to
enable the tracker only while the native API is connected. The following config will achieve this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:
      scan_parameters:
        continuous: false

    api:
      encryption:
        key: !secret encryption_key
      on_client_connected:
        - esp32_ble_tracker.start_scan:
           continuous: true
      on_client_disconnected:
        - esp32_ble_tracker.stop_scan:
