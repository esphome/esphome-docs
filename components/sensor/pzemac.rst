    This page is incomplete and could some work. If you want to contribute, please read the
    :doc:`contributing guide </guides/contributing>`. This page is missing:

      - An image for the front page.
      - Images/screenshots/example configs of this device being used in action.

The ``pzemac`` sensor platform allows you to use PZEM-004T V3 energy monitors
(`website <https://innovatorsguru.com/pzem-004t-v3/>`__,
`datasheet <https://innovatorsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PZEM-004T-V3.0-Datasheet-User-Manual.pdf>`__)
with ESPHome.

The sensor can be connected in various configurations - please see the `manufacturer's website <https://innovatorsguru.com/pzem-004t-v3/>`__
for more information.

.. warning::

    This page refers to version V3 of the PZEM004T.
    For using the older V1 variant of this sensor please see :doc:`pzem004t <pzem004t>`.

The communication with this integration is done over a :ref:`UART bus <uart>`.
You must therefore have a ``uart:`` entry in your configuration with both the TX and RX pins set
to some pins on your board and the baud rate set to 9600.

        current:
          name: "PZEM-004T V3 Current"
        voltage:
          name: "PZEM-004T V3 Voltage"
        energy:
          name: "PZEM-004T V3 Energy"
        power:
          name: "PZEM-004T V3 Power"
        frequency:
          name: "PZEM-004T V3 Frequency"

        update_interval: 60s

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **current** (*Optional*): Use the current value of the sensor in amperes. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **energy** (*Optional*): Use the (active) energy value of the sensor in watt*hours. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **power** (*Optional*): Use the (active) power value of the sensor in watts. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **voltage** (*Optional*): Use the voltage value of the sensor in volts.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **frequency** (*Optional*): Use the frequency value of the sensor in hertz.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **power_factor** (*Optional*): Use the power factor value of the sensor.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.
- **address** (*Optional*, int): The address of the sensor if multiple sensors are attached to
  the same UART bus. You will need to set the address of each device manually. Defaults to ``1``.
