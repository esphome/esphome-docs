    :description: Instructions for setting up a Binary Sensor Map
    :image: binary_sensor_map.jpg

The ``binary_sensor_map`` sensor platform allows you to map multiple :doc:`binary sensor </components/binary_sensor/index>`
to an individual value. Depending on the state of each binary sensor, its associated configured parameters, and this sensor's mapping type,
the ``binary_sensor_map`` publishes a single numerical value.

Use this sensor to combine one or more binary sensors' ``ON`` or ``OFF`` states into a numerical value. Some possible use cases include
touch devices and determining Bayesian probabilities for an event.

This platform supports three measurement types: ``BAYESIAN``, ``GROUP``, and ``SUM``.
You need to specify your desired mapping with the ``type:`` configuration value.

When using the ``BAYESIAN`` type, add your binary sensors as ``observations`` to the binary sensor map.
If you use the ``GROUP`` or ``SUM`` type, add your binary sensors as ``channels``.
The maximum amount of observations/channels supported is 64.

- ``BAYESIAN`` This type replicates Home Assistant's `Bayesian sensor <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bayesian/>`__. Based on the observation states, this sensor returns the Bayesian probability of a particular event occurring. The configured ``prior:`` probability is the likelihood that the Bayesian event is true, ignoring all external influences. Every observation has its own ``prob_given_true`` and ``prob_given_false`` parameters. The ``prob_given_true:`` value is the probability that the observation's binary sensor is ``ON`` when the Bayesian event is ``true``. The ``prob_given_false:`` value is the probability that the observation's binary sensor is ``ON`` when the Bayesian event is ``false``. Use an :doc:`/components/binary_sensor/analog_threshold` to convert this sensor's probability to a binary ``ON`` or ``OFF`` by setting an appropriate threshold.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: binary_sensor_map
        id: bayesian_prob
        name: 'Bayesian Event Probability'
        type: bayesian
        prior: 0.4
        observations:
          - binary_sensor: binary_sensor_0
            prob_given_true: 0.9
            prob_given_false: 0.2
          - binary_sensor: binary_sensor_1
            prob_given_true: 0.6
            prob_given_false: 0.1

    binary_sensor:
      # If the Bayesian probability is greater than 0.6,
      # then predict the event is occuring
      - platform: analog_threshold
        name: "Bayesian Event Predicted State"
        sensor_id: bayesian_prob
        threshold: 0.6
      # ...

- ``GROUP`` Each channel has its own ``value``. The sensor publishes the average value of all active
  binary sensors or ``NAN`` if no sensors are active.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: binary_sensor_map
        id: group_0
        name: 'Group Map 0'
        type: GROUP
        channels:
          - binary_sensor: touchkey0
            value: 0
          - binary_sensor: touchkey1
            value: 10
          - binary_sensor: touchkey2
            value: 20
          - binary_sensor: touchkey3
            value: 30

    # Example binary sensors using MPR121 component
    mpr121:
      id: mpr121_first
      address: 0x5A

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: mpr121
        channel: 0
        id: touchkey0
      # ...

- ``SUM`` Each channel has its own ``value``. The sensor publishes the sum of all the active
  binary sensors values or ``0`` if no sensors are active.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: binary_sensor_map
        id: group_0
        name: 'Group Map 0'
        type: sum
        channels:
          - binary_sensor: bit0
            value: 1
          - binary_sensor: bit1
            value: 2
          - binary_sensor: bit2
            value: 4
          - binary_sensor: bit3
            value: 8

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIOXX
        id: bit0

      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIOXX
        id: bit1

      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIOXX
        id: bit2

      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIOXX
        id: bit3
      # ...

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **type** (**Required**, string): The sensor type. Should be one of: ``BAYESIAN``, ``GROUP``, or ``SUM``.
- **channels** (**Required for GROUP or SUM types**): A list of channels that are mapped to certain values.

  - **binary_sensor** (**Required**): The id of the :doc:`binary sensor </components/binary_sensor/index>`
    to add as a channel for this sensor.
  - **value** (**Required**): The value this channel should report when its binary sensor is active.
- **prior** (**Required for BAYESIAN type**, float between 0 and 1): The prior probability of the event.
- **observations** (**Required for BAYESIAN type**): A list of observations that influence the Bayesian probability of the event.

  - **binary_sensor** (**Required**): The id of the :doc:`binary sensor </components/binary_sensor/index>`
