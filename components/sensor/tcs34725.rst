The ``tcs34725`` sensor platform enables the integration of TCS34725 RGB color sensors
(`datasheet <https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/TCS34725.pdf>`__, `Adafruit`_)
into ESPHome, providing precise data on color, color temperature, and illuminance. The
sensor requires a properly configured :ref:`I²C <i2c>` interface in your setup.

This sensor supports adjustable exposure times ranging from 153.6 ms to 614.4 ms.
Increasing the exposure time enhances light sensitivity, making the sensor more
responsive to subtle lighting changes. However, longer exposure times also lower the
maximum brightness the sensor can handle before overexposing. When this occurs, the
sensor_saturation will reach 100%, and the sensor will stop providing illuminance or
color temperature values.

The gain setting can also be adjusted to increase light sensitivity, but it further
reduces the brightness threshold before overexposure and may add more noise to the data.

Setting the exposure time to `auto` will adjust the exposure time between 153.6 and
614.4 ms and also adjust the gain, as necessary.

Note: The sensor also allows for exposure times below 153.6 ms. However, shorter
exposure times don’t decrease the sensor’s sensitivity; instead, they reduce the
resolution of the data. Exposure times below 50 ms can cause ripple effects from the
power grid’s frequency, which may interfere with the sensor data. It’s recommended to
avoid these shorter exposure times unless there's a specific use case.

- **glass_attenuation_factor** (*Optional*): The attenuation factor of glass if it's behind some glass facia. 
  Default is ``1.0`` means ``100%`` transmissivity. ``2`` means ``50%`` transmissivity etc.
- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor. Defaults to ``0x29``.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The time between updates are fetched from the sensor. Defaults
  to ``60s``.
