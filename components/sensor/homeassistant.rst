    :description: Instructions for setting up Home Assistant sensors with ESPHome that import states from your Home Assistant instance.
    :image: home-assistant.png

The ``homeassistant`` sensor platform allows you to create sensors that import
states from your Home Assistant instance using the :doc:`native API </components/api>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        name: "Temperature Sensor From Home Assistant"
        entity_id: sensor.temperature_sensor

.. note::

    This component is only for numeral states. If you want to import arbitrary text states
    from Home Assistant, use the :doc:`Home Assistant Text Sensor </components/text_sensor/homeassistant>`.
    
    Albeit you might not plan to __export__ states from the node and you do not need an entity of the node
    in Home Assistant, this component still requires you to register the node under Home Assistant. See:
    :doc:`Getting started with Home Assistant </guides/getting_started_hassio>`

    Importing attributes is currently not supported, but you can create template sensors in Home Assistant
    that return the attribute of a sensor and then import the template sensor here.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the sensor.
- **entity_id** (**Required**, string): The entity ID to import from Home Assistant.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
