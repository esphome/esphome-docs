    :description: Instructions for setting up Home Assistant sensors with ESPHome that import states from your Home Assistant instance.
    :image: home-assistant.svg

The ``homeassistant`` sensor platform allows you to create sensors that import
states from your Home Assistant instance using the :doc:`native API </components/api>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        name: "Temperature Sensor From Home Assistant"
        entity_id: sensor.temperature_sensor

Entity state attributes can also be imported:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        id: current_temperature
        entity_id: climate.living_room
        attribute: current_temperature

.. note::

    This component is only for numeral states. If you want to import arbitrary text states
    from Home Assistant, use the :doc:`Home Assistant Text Sensor </components/text_sensor/homeassistant>`.

    Although you might not plan to *export* states from the node and you do not need an entity of the node
    in Home Assistant, this component still requires you to register the node under Home Assistant. See:
    :doc:`Getting started with Home Assistant </guides/getting_started_hassio>`

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the sensor.
- **entity_id** (**Required**, string): The entity ID to import from Home Assistant.
- **attribute** (*Optional*, string): The name of the state attribute to import from the
  specified entity. The entity state is used when this option is omitted.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.


.. note::

    The sensors implemented by this component are by default ``internal``, to avoid exporting them back to
    Home Assistant. Should you still want to do that (eg. because you use ESPHome's very efficient filters
    on them) you need to specifically configure ``internal: false``. Also, ``state_class``, ``unit_of_measurement``
    are not inherited from the imported sensor so you need to set them manually.
