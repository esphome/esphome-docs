    :description: Instructions for setting up HLW8012 power sensors for the Sonoff Pow R1

    :keywords: HLW8012, Sonoff Pow R1

The ``hlw8012`` sensor platform allows you to use your HLW8012 voltage/current and power sensors
(`datasheet <https://github.com/xoseperez/hlw8012/blob/master/docs/HLW8012.pdf>`__) sensors with
ESPHome. This sensor is commonly found in Sonoff POWs.

.. note::

    SAFETY HAZARD: Some devices such as Sonoff POWs/Shelly/etc, have the digital GND connected directly to mains voltage so **the GPIOs become LIVE during normal operation**. Our advice is to mark these boards to prevent any use of the dangerous digital pins.

This sensor has two data outputs which both encode values using the frequency of a modulated signal: CF and CF1.
CF's frequency is proportional to the (active) power measured and CF1 is proportional to the current/voltage. Using
the SEL pin, one can choose between which mode to use.

ESPHome will continuously cycle the state of the SEL pin to measure current *and* voltage, though both cannot
be measured at the same exact points in time.

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: hlw8012
        sel_pin: 5
        cf_pin: 14
        cf1_pin: 13
        current:
          name: "HLW8012 Current"
        voltage:
          name: "HLW8012 Voltage"
        power:
          name: "HLW8012 Power"
        energy:
          name: "HLW8012 Energy"
        update_interval: 60s

.. note::

    The configuration above should work for Sonoff POWs (R1).

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **sel_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin SEL is connected to.
- **cf_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin CF is connected to.
- **cf1_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin CF1 is connected to.
- **current** (*Optional*): Use the current value of the sensor in amperes. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **power** (*Optional*): Use the (active) power value of the sensor in watts. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **voltage** (*Optional*): Use the voltage value of the sensor in V (RMS).
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **energy** (*Optional*): Use the total energy value of the sensor in Wh.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.

Advanced Options:

- **current_resistor** (*Optional*, float): The value of the shunt resistor for current measurement.
  Defaults to the Sonoff POW's value ``0.001 ohm``.
- **voltage_divider** (*Optional*, float): The value of the voltage divider on the board as ``(R_upstream + R_downstream) / R_downstream``.
  Defaults to the Sonoff POW's value ``2351``.
- **change_mode_every** (*Optional*, int): After how many updates to cycle between the current/voltage measurement mode.
  Note that the first value after switching is discarded because it is often inaccurate. Defaults to ``8``.
- **initial_mode** (*Optional*, string): The initial measurement mode. Defaults to ``VOLTAGE``.
  Possible initial measurement modes are ``VOLTAGE`` or ``CURRENT``.

Permanent SEL Pin
-----------------

Some devices have the SEL pin permanently pulled high or low. If this is the case, you can configure
the initial measurement mode to match whichever mode the device uses, and disable mode switching.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry for device with fixed measurement mode
    sensor:
      - platform: hlw8012
        sel_pin: 5
        cf_pin: 14
        cf1_pin: 13
        current:
          name: "HLW8012 Current"
        voltage:
          name: "HLW8012 Voltage"
        power:
          name: "HLW8012 Power"
        update_interval: 60s
        initial_mode: CURRENT
        change_mode_every: 4294967295
