    :image: sen54.jpg

The ``sen5x`` sensor platform allows you to use your Sensirion `SEN50 <https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN50/>`__, `SEN54 <https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN54/>`__ and `SEN55 <https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN55/>`__ Environmental sensor (`datasheet <https://sensirion.com/media/documents/6791EFA0/62A1F68F/Sensirion_Datasheet_Environmental_Node_SEN5x.pdf>`__) sensors with ESPHome.
The :ref:`I²C Bus <i2c>` is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.
This sensor supports both UART and I²C communication. Only I²C communication is implemented in this component.

    - **learning_time_offset_hours** (*Optional*): Time constant to estimate the NOx algorithm offset from the history in hours. Past events will be forgotten after about twice the  learning time. Allowed values are in range 1..1000. The default value is 12 hour

- **store_baseline** (*Optional*, boolean): Stores and retrieves the baseline VOC and NOx information for quicker startups. Defaults to ``true``
- **temperature_compensation** (*Optional*): These parameters allow to compensate temperature effects of the design-in at customer side by applying a custom temperature offset to the ambient temperature.

  The compensated ambient temperature is calculated as follows:

      T_Ambient_Compensated = T_Ambient + (slope*T_Ambient) + offset

  Where slope and offset are the values set with this command, smoothed with the specified time constant. The time constant is how fast the slope and offset are applied. After the specified value in seconds, 63% of the new slope and offset are applied.
  More details about the tuning of these parameters are included in the application note `Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x. <https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf>`__


  - **offset** (*Optional*): Temperature offset [°C]. Defaults to ``0``
  - **normalized_offset_slope** (*Optional*): Normalized temperature offset slope. Defaults to ``0``
  - **time_constant** (*Optional*): Time constant in seconds. Defaults to ``0``

- **acceleration_mode** (*Optional*): Allowed value are ``low``, ``medium`` and ``high``. (default is ``low``)

  By default, the RH/T acceleration algorithm is optimized for a sensor which is positioned in free air. If the sensor is integrated into another device, the ambient RH/T output values might not be optimal due to different thermal behavior.
  This parameter can be used to adapt the RH/T acceleration behavior for the actual use-case, leading in an improvement of the ambient RH/T output accuracy. There is a limited set of different modes available.
  Medium and high accelerations are particularly indicated for air quality monitors which are subjected to large temperature changes. Low acceleration is advised for stationary devices not subject to large variations in temperature

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor.
  Defaults to ``0x69``.

.. note::

    The sensor needs about a minute "warm-up". The VOC and NOx gas index algorithm needs a number of samples before the values stabilize.


Wiring:
-------

The sensor has a JST GHR-06V-S 6 pin type connector, with a 1.25mm pitch. The cable needs this connector:

.. figure:: images/jst6pin.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50.0%

To force the sensor into I²C mode, the SEL pin (Interface Select pin no.5) must be shorted to ground (pin no.2). Pin 6 is not used.

For better stability, the SDA and SCL lines require suitable pull-up resistors.

Automatic Cleaning:
-------------------

When the module is in Measurement-Mode an automatic fan-cleaning procedure will be triggered periodically following a defined cleaning interval. This will accelerate the fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds to blow out the accumulated dust inside the fan.

- Measurement values are not updated while the fan-cleaning is running.
- The cleaning interval is set to 604’800 seconds (i.e., 168 hours or 1 week).
- The interval can be configured using the Set Automatic Cleaning Interval command.
- Set the interval to 0 to disable the automatic cleaning.
- A sensor reset, resets the cleaning interval to its default value
- If the sensor is switched off, the time counter is reset to 0. Make sure to trigger a cleaning cycle at least every week if the sensor is switched off and on periodically (e.g., once per day).
- The cleaning procedure can also be started manually with the ``start_autoclean_fan`` Action

The Sen5x sensor has an automatic fan-cleaning which will accelerate the built-in fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds in order to blow out the dust accumulated inside the fan.
The default automatic-cleaning interval is 168 hours (1 week) of uninterrupted use. Switching off the sensor resets this time counter.

.. _start_autoclean_fan_action:

``sen5x.start_fan_autoclean`` Action
------------------------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` manually starts fan-cleaning.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: sen54
