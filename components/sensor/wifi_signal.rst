WiFi Signal Sensor

The ``wifi_signal`` sensor platform allows you to read the signal
strength of the currently connected :doc:`WiFi Access Point </components/wifi>`.

The sensor value is the `"Received signal strength indication" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication>`__
measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm). These values are always negative and the closer they are to zero, the better the signal is.

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: wifi_signal
        name: "WiFi Signal Sensor"
        update_interval: 60s

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the WiFi signal sensor.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval
  to check the sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

.. warning::

    Signal strength readings are only available when WiFi is in station mode. Readings are not valid
    if the device is acting as an access point without any station mode connection.
