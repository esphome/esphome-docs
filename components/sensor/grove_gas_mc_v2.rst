The ``grove_gas_mc_v2`` sensor platform allows you to use your `Grove Multichannel Gas
Sensor V2 <https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Multichannel-Gas-Sensor-V2>`__ 
with ESPHome. It exposes 4 different gas sensors for qualitatively measuring
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ethanol (C2H5OH), and Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs).

.. note::

    The Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor V2 is a qualitative, not quantitative, sensor.
    This means values reported back are raw ADC values. Values are **not** in a common unit
    of measurement, such as PPM (parts per million). If you have known baseline readings
    for any of the gases, :ref:`sensor-filters` could be used to calibrate the raw readings.

    Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor V2

The communication with this sensor is done via :ref:`I²C Bus <i2c>`, so you need to have
an ``i2c:`` section in your config for this integration to work.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: grove_gas_mc_v2
        no2:
          name: "Nitrogen Dioxide"
        ethanol:
          name: "Ethanol"
        carbon_monoxide:
          name: "Carbon Monoxide"
        tvoc:
          name: "Volatile Organic Compounds"

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **no2** (**Required**): The Nitrogen Dioxide sensor data.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **ethanol** (**Required**): The Ethanol (C2H5OH) sensor data.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **carbon_monoxide** (**Required**): The Carbon Monoxide sensor data.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **tvoc** (**Required**): The Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) sensor data.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.

Advanced:

- **address** (*Optional*, int): The :ref:`I²C <i2c>` address of the sensor.
  Defaults to ``0x08``

.. _grove-gas-mc-v2-preheating:

Preheating
--------------------

If the sensor is stored for a long period of time (without power) there is a recommended
minimum warm-up time required for the sensor before the readings settle down and become
more accurate.

A recommended warm-up time of 24 hours is recommend if the sensor has been stored
less than a month, 48 hours for 1-6 months and at least 72 hours for anything longer
than 6 months.
