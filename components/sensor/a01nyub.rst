This sensor allows you to use A01NYUB waterproof ultrasonic sensor by DFRobot 
(`datasheet <https://wiki.dfrobot.com/A01NYUB%20Waterproof%20Ultrasonic%20Sensor%20SKU:%20SEN0313>`__)
with ESPHome to measure distances. This sensor can measure
ranges between 28 centimeters and 750 centimeters with a resolution of 1 milimeter.

Since this sensor reads multiple times per second, :ref:`sensor-filters` are highly recommended.

To use the sensor, first set up an :ref:`uart` with a baud rate of 9600 and connect the sensor to the specified pin.
