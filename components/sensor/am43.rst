AM43 Sensor

The ``am43`` sensor platform allows you to read the light and
battery sensors on an AM43 BLE cover motor. The platform connects
to the device over the ESP32's BLE peripheral.

.. note::

    This component does NOT support Tuya-based versions of this device,
    as the protocol is completely different. If your device is controlled
    with the SmartLife app, then it will not work.

    # Example configuration entry

    esp32_ble_tracker:

    ble_client:
      - mac: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
        id: am43_device

    sensor:
      - platform: am43
        ble_client_id: am43_device
        battery_level:
          name: "Kitchen blinds battery"
        illuminance:
          name: "Kitchen blinds light"

For more details on setting up this device, see the
:doc:`/components/cover/am43` component.
