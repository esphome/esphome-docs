Component/Hub
-------------

The ``bme680_bsec`` sensor platform allows you to use your BME680
(`datasheet <https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/3660/BME680.pdf>`__,
`Adafruit`_) temperature, pressure and humidity and gas sensors with ESPHome via the Bosch Sensortec Environmental Cluster (BSEC)
software library. The use of Bosch's proprietary algorithms provides additional Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), CO2 equivalent and Breath
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) equivalent measurements.

.. note::

    The Bosch BSEC library is only available for use after accepting its software license agreement. By enabling this component,
    you are explicitly agreeing to the terms of the `BSEC license agreement`_. You must not distribute any compiled firmware
    binaries that include this component.

The :ref:`I²C <i2c>` is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

    # Minimal example configuration with common sensors
    i2c:

    bme680_bsec:

    sensor:
      - platform: bme680_bsec
        temperature:
          name: "BME680 Temperature"
        pressure:
          name: "BME680 Pressure"
        humidity:
          name: "BME680 Humidity"
        iaq:
          name: "BME680 IAQ"
        co2_equivalent:
          name: "BME680 CO2 Equivalent"
        breath_voc_equivalent:
          name: "BME680 Breath VOC Equivalent"

    text_sensor:
      - platform: bme680_bsec
        iaq_accuracy:
          name: "BME680 IAQ Accuracy"

Configuration variables:

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I^2C address of the sensor. Defaults to ``0x76``. Another address can be ``0x77``.

- **temperature_offset** (*Optional*, float): Temperature offset if device is in enclosure and reads too high.
  Defaults to ``0``.

- **iaq_mode** (*Optional*, string): IAQ calculation mode. Default is ``static`` for static applications (e.g. fixed indoor devices).
  Can be ``mobile`` for mobile applications (e.g. carry-on devices).

- **sample_rate** (*Optional*, string): Sample rate. Default is ``lp`` for low power consumption, sampling every 3 seconds.
  Can be ``ulp`` for ultra low power, sampling every 5 minutes.
  This controls the sampling rate for gas-dependant sensors and will govern the interval at which the sensor heater is operated.
  By default this rate will also be used for temperature, pressure and humidity sensors but these can be overridden on a per-sensor level if required.

- **state_save_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The minimum interval at which to save calibrated BSEC algorithm state to
  flash so that calibration does have to start from zero on device restart. Defaults to ``6h``.

Advanced configuration
----------------------

The following configuration shows all the available sensors and optional settings for the component. It also includes an example of filtering to guard against
outliers, limit the number of updates sent to home assistant and reduce storage requirements in other systems such as influxdb used to store historical data.

For each sensor all other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>` and :ref:`TextSensor <config-text_sensor>` are also available for filtering, automation and so on.

Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Measurement
------------------------------------

Indoor Air Quality measurements are expressed in the IAQ index scale with 25IAQ corresponding to typical good air and 250IAQ
indicating typical polluted air after calibration.

.. _bsec-calibration:

IAQ Accuracy and Calibration
----------------------------

The BSEC algorithm automatically gathers data in order to calibrate the IAQ measurements. The IAQ Accuracy sensor will give one
of the following values:

- ``Stabilizing``: The device has just started, and the sensor is stabilizing (this typically lasts 5 minutes)
- ``Uncertain``: The background history of BSEC is uncertain. This typically means the gas sensor data was too
  stable for BSEC to clearly define its reference.
- ``Calibrating``: BSEC found new calibration data and is currently calibrating.
- ``Calibrated``: BSEC calibrated successfully.

Every ``state_save_interval``, or as soon thereafter as full calibration is reached, the current algorithm state is saved to flash
so that the process does not have to start from zero on device restart.
