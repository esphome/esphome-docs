    Honeywell ABP Pressure and Temperature Sensor.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: honeywellabp
        pressure:
          name: Honeywell pressure
          min_pressure: 0
          max_pressure: 15
        temperature:
          name: Honeywell temperature
        cs_pin: GPIOXX

Configuration variables:
------------------------

The values for ``min_pressure`` and ``max_pressure`` can be found in the device datasheet for the specific device. These are used to calculate
the pressure reading published by the sensor. Some sensors measure pressure in ``bar`` or ``kPa``; set ``min_pressure`` and ``max_pressure`` to
the measurement range and ``unit_of_measurement`` to the appropriate unit for your device.

- **pressure** (*Optional*): The information for the pressure sensor.

  - **min_pressure** (**Required**, int or float): Minimum pressure for the pressure sensor, default unit ``psi``.
  - **max_pressure** (**Required**, int or float): Maximum pressure for the pressure sensor, default unit ``psi``.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

Some sensors do not have temperature sensing ability, see datasheet. In some cases the sensor may return a valid temperature even though the
datasheet indicates that the sensor does not measure temperature.

- **temperature** (*Optional*): The information for the temperature sensor.

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the temperature sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.


- **cs_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`SPI <spi>`): Chip select pin.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.
