    :description: Instructions for setting up a Statistics Sensor

The ``statistics`` sensor platform quickly generates summary statistics from another sensorâ€™s measurements. See :ref:`statistics-description` for information about the available summary statistics.

The component calculates statistics over a sliding window or a resettable continuous window. See :ref:`window-types` for details about each possible type.

Each summary statistic sensor is optional, and the component stores the measurement information only necessary for the enabled sensors. The component uses external memory on ESP32 boards if available. See :ref:`external_memory` for details.

You could also use :ref:`sensor-filters` to compute some of the available summary statistics over a sliding window. In contrast, this component allows you to generate multiple summary statistics from the same source sensor. Additionally, it calculates them more efficiently than sensors filters.

To use the component, first, provide the source sensor and then configure the window settings and the desired statistics.

.. _window-types:

Window Types
------------

There are two categories of windows. The first category is a sliding window. A sliding window has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements. The component inserts sensor measurements until it has inserted ``window_size`` total. Before this component inserts another sensor measurement, it removes the oldest measurement in the window.

The second category is a continuous window. This category of windows has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements or a pre-defined duration ``window_duration``. The component inserts sensor measurements until it inserts ``window_size`` total or the difference between the timestamps of the oldest and most recent sensor measurements exceeds ``window_duration``. Then, this component removes **all** of the sensor measurements in the window.

Instead of inserting individual measurements, the component can combine several sensor measurements into a chunk. When this chunk exceeds ``chunk_size`` sensor measurements or ``chunk_size`` duration, this component adds that chunk to the window. This approach saves memory for sliding windows, as memory does not hold every individual sensor measurement but only stores several sensor measurements combined. For continuous windows, this improves accuracy for significantly large windows.

If you want to collect statistics from a significant number of measurements (potentially unlimited), use a ``chunked_continuous`` type. It uses slightly more memory and is slower but is numerically accurate. A ``continuous`` type uses very little memory and is extremely fast. However, it can lose accuracy with significantly large windows.

General Advice
--------------

Average Types
*************

You can configure the average type to equally weigh each sensor measurement using ``simple`` or weigh each measurement by its duration using ``time_weighted``. If your sensor updates have a consistent update interval, then ``simple`` should work well. If your sensor is not updated consistently, then choose the ``time_weighted`` type. Note that with the ``time_weighted`` type, the component does not insert a sensor measurement into the window until it receives another sensor measurement; i.e., there is a delay of one measurement. This delay is necessary to determine each measurementâ€™s duration.


.. _external_memory:

External Memory
***************

If you use an ESP32 board with external memory, then this component will automatically store sensor measurements in the external memory. Just add ``psram:`` to your configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example external memory configuration
    psram:

    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
      ...

Group Types
***********

You can configure whether the component considers the set of sensor measurements to be a population or a sample using the ``population`` or ``sample`` type respectively. This setting affects the standard deviation ``std_dev`` sensor. For sliding windows or continuous windows that reset the ``sample`` type is appropriate. If you use a ``chunked_continuous`` window type without automatic reset, you should most likely use the ``population`` type.

Trend Sensor
************

The trend sensor may be unstable over a small set of sensor measurements, especially if the sensor is noisy. To avoid this, use a trend sensor on large windows; e.g., 50 or more sensor measurements. Or, apply a smoothing filter like an exponential moving average to the source sensor.

Which Continuous Window Type to Choose
**************************************

If you collect long-term statistics that include thousands (or more) of measurements, you should use the ``chunked_continuous`` window type. If you only collect statistics over a smaller set of measurements, then use the ``continuous`` window type.

Which Sliding Window Type to Choose
***********************************

Unless you need your statistics to update after every sensor measurement or you need to set the ``send_every`` option to a number that does not divide ``window_size``, you should use the ``chunked_sliding`` window type.


Example Configurations
----------------------

One Minute Window Published Every Minute
****************************************

Suppose you want to send the mean/average of a sensorâ€™s measurements over the last minute updated once every minute.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # All time mean
    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
        source_id: source_measurement_sensor_id
        window:
          type: chunked_continuous
          window_size: 0          # disables automatic resets
          chunk_duration: 15min
          send_every: 1

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Mean Sensor
    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
        source_id: temperature_sensor
        id: daily_temperature_stats
        window:
          type: chunked_continuous
          window_size: 0        # we will manually reset the window
          chunk_duration: 15min
        mean:
          name: "Temperature Mean (Day so Far)"

    time:
      - platform: homeassistant

        on_time:
          # force publish 1 second before midnight so we do not miss the last chunk
          - seconds: 59
            minutes: 59
            hours: 23
            then:

          # reset window at midnight
          - seconds: 0
            minutes: 0
            hours: 0
            then:
              - sensor.statistics.reset: daily_temperature_stats

Automation Actions
------------------

``sensor.statistics.force_publish`` Action
******************************************

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to force all statistics sensors to publish an update. Note, the action may send statistics over a window larger than configured for ``chunked_sliding`` types.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - sensor.statistics.force_publish:  my_statistics_component  

``sensor.statistics.reset`` Action
**********************************

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to reset all the statistics by clearing all stored measurements in the window. 
For example, you could use a time-based automation to reset all the statistics sensors at midnight.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - sensor.statistics.reset:  my_statistics_component
