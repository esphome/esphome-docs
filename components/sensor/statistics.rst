    :description: Instructions for setting up a Statistics Sensor

The ``statistics`` sensor platform quickly generates summary statistics from another sensorâ€™s measurements. See :ref:`statistics-description` for information about the available summary statistics.

The component calculates statistics over a sliding window or a resettable continuous window. See :ref:`window-types` for details about each possible type.

Each summary statistic sensor is optional, and the component stores the measurement information only necessary for the enabled sensors. The component uses external memory on ESP32 boards if available.

You could also use :ref:`sensor-filters` to compute some of the available summary statistics over a sliding window. In contrast, this component allows you to generate multiple summary statistics from the same source sensor. Additionally, it calculates them more efficiently than sensors filters.

To use the component, first, provide the source sensor and then configure the window settings and the desired statistics.

.. _window-types:

Window Types
------------

There are two categories of windows. The first category is a sliding window. A sliding window has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements. The component inserts sensor measurements until it has inserted ``window_size`` total. When full, this component removes the oldest measurement in the window and then inserts the newwest senesor measurement.

The second category is a continuous window. This category of windows has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements. The component inserts sensor measurements until it inserts ``window_size`` total. Then, this component removes **all** of the sensor measurements in the window. If ``window_size`` is set to ``0``, then the window is **never** reset.

Instead of inserting individual measurements, the component can first combine several sensor measurements into a chunk. When this chunk exceeds ``chunk_size`` sensor measurements or ``chunk_duration`` time has passed, this component adds that chunk to the window. This approach saves memory for sliding windows, as memory does not hold every individual sensor measurement but only stores several sensor measurements combined into the chunk. For continuous windows, this improves accuracy for significantly large windows.

If you want to collect statistics from a significant number of measurements (potentially unlimited), use a ``continuous_long_term`` type. It uses slightly more memory and is slightly slower but is numerically more accurate than a ``continuous`` type. A ``continuous`` type uses very little memory and is extremely fast. However, it may lose accuracy with significantly large windows.

.. _statistics-description:

General Advice
--------------

Average Types
*************

You can configure the average type to equally weigh each sensor measurement using ``simple`` or weigh each measurement by its duration using ``time_weighted``. If your sensor updates have a consistent update interval, then ``simple`` should work well. If your sensor is not updated consistently, then choose the ``time_weighted`` type. Note that with the ``time_weighted`` type, the component does not insert a sensor measurement into the window until it receives another sensor measurement; i.e., there is a delay of one measurement. This delay is necessary to determine each measurementâ€™s duration.

Group Types
***********

You can configure whether the component considers the set of sensor measurements to be a population or a sample using the ``population`` or ``sample`` type respectively. This setting affects the standard deviation ``std_dev`` sensor. For sliding windows or continuous windows that reset the ``sample`` type is usually appropriate. If you use a ``continuous`` or ``continuous_long_term`` window type without automatic reset, you should most likely use the ``population`` type.

Trend Sensor
************

The trend sensor may be unstable over a small set of sensor measurements, especially if the sensor is noisy. To avoid this, use a trend sensor on large windows; e.g., 50 or more sensor measurements. Or, apply a smoothing filter like an exponential moving average to the source sensor.

Which Continuous Window Type to Choose
**************************************

If you collect long-term statistics that include thousands (or more) of measurements, you should use the ``continuous_long_term`` window type, as it is more accurate. If you only collect statistics over a smaller set of measurements, then use the ``continuous`` window type.

Example Configurations
----------------------

Statistics Automation
---------------------

``sensor.statistics.force_publish`` Action
******************************************

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to force all statistics sensors to publish an update. Note, the action may send statistics over a different window size than configured for ``sliding`` types.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - sensor.statistics.force_publish:  my_statistics_component  

``sensor.statistics.reset`` Action
**********************************

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to reset all the statistics by clearing all stored measurements in the window. 
For example, you could use a time-based automation to reset all the statistics sensors at midnight.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - sensor.statistics.reset:  my_statistics_component  

.. _on-update-trigger:

``sensor.statistics.on_update`` Trigger
***************************************

This automation will be triggered after all configured sensors have updated. In :ref:`Lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can get the ``Aggregate`` object containing all the statistics (for the configured sensors only) from the trigger with ``x``. See :ref:`lambdas-aggregate-functions` for available functions.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
        # ...
        on_update:
          then:
            - logger.log: "Statistics sensors have all updated"


.. _lambdas-aggregate-functions:

Lambdas using ``Aggregate`` Object Functions

    - returns the timestamp reference as a ``uint32_t`` type
    - available if ``trend`` sensor is configured

These raw statistics may be useful using their native data type. For example, the ``since_argmax`` and ``since_argmin`` sensors give the time since the most recent maximum or minimum value respectively. The component actually stores the Unix UTC time (in seconds) of when the maximum or minimum value occured. These native integer values are so large, that the ``float`` data type used for sensors in ESPHome and Home Assistant is only accurate to within 1 or 2 minutes of the actual value due to floating point precision issues, despite this component nativally storing the value accurate to the second.

Another use case is to compute statistics that are not available as a sensor. In this example, we will compute the linear coeffecient of determination (rÂ²) of the set of measurements and timestamps. The value of rÂ² gives the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
        source_id: source_measurement_sensor_id
        window:
          type: sliding
          window_size: 4          # 4 chunks of duration 15 seconds for a sliding window over 1 minute
          chunk_duration: 15s
          send_every: 1
        trend:
          name: "Sensor 1 Minute Trend"
        on_update:
          then:
            - lambda: |-
                double c2 = x.get_c2();   // c2/count gives covariance
                double m2 = x.get_m2();   // m2/count gives variance
                double timestamp_m2 = x.get_timestamp_m2();   // timestamp_m2/count gives variance of the timestamps

                // The linear coeffecient of determination is given by covariance^2/(variance*timestamp_variance)
                // The counts in covarance, variance, and timestamp_variance would all cancel, so we get
                double r_squared = (c2*c2)/(m2*timestamp_m2);

                // Update a template sensor with r_squared
                id(sensor_1min_r_squared).publish_state(r_squared);

      - platform: template
        name: "Sensor 1 Minute Linear Coeffecient of Determination"
        id: sensor_1min_r_squared
        update_interval: never    # the statistics component will update
