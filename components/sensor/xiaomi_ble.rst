The ``xiaomi_ble`` sensor platform lets you track the output of Xiaomi Bluetooth Low Energy devices using the :doc:`/components/esp32_ble_tracker`. This component will track, for example, the temperature, humidity, moisture, conductivity, illuminance, formaldehyde, mosquito tablet and battery level of the device every time the sensor sends out a BLE broadcast. Contrary to other implementations, ``xiaomi_ble`` listense passively to advertisement packets and does not pair with the device. Hence ESPHome has no impact on battery life.

      - platform: xiaomi_mjyd02yla
        name: "MJYD02YL-A Night Light"
        mac_address: "50:EC:50:CD:32:02"

          name: "MJYD02YL-A Battery Level"
        illuminance:
          name: "MJYD02YL-A Illuminance"

Setting Up Devices
------------------

Required:

- **mac_address** (MAC Address): The MAC address of the device.
- **bindkey** (string, 32 characters, case insensitive): The key to decrypt the BLE advertisements for encrypted sensor types

Optional with **name**, **id** (:ref:`config-id`) and all other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`:

- **temperature**
- **humidity**
- **moisture**
- **illuminance**
- **conductivity**
- **tablet**
- **formaldehyde**
- **battery_level**

To find the MAC Address so that ESPHome can identify the device, you can create a simple configuration without any sensor entries:

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

After uploading, the ESP32 will immediately try to scan for BLE devices. When it detects a new sensor, it will automatically parse the BLE message print a message like this one:

.. code::

    Found device A4:C1:38:4E:16:78 RSSI=-78
      Address Type: PUBLIC
      Name: 'LYWSD03MMC'

It can sometimes take some time for the first BLE broadcast to be received. Once the device has been found, copy the address ``A4:C1:38:4E:16:78`` into a new platform entry like shown in the example configurations.

.. _obtaining_the_bindkey:

Obtaining The Bindkey
---------------------

To set up an encrypted device such as the LYWSD03MMC (with Xiaomi stock firmware) and CGD1, you first need to obtain the bind key. The ``xiaomi_ble`` sensor component is not able to automatically generate a bind key so other workarounds are necessary.

LYWSD03MMC
**********

If the LYWSD03MMC sensor is operated with the Xiaomi stock firmware, you can use the `TeLink flasher application <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>`__ to easily generate a new bind key and upload the key to the device without the need to flash a new firmware (see figure). For this, you load the flasher `webpage <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>`__ with a `supported browser <https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/master/implementation-status.md>`__ and connect the device by pressing "Connect". After the connection is established, you press the "Do Activation" button and the new key will be shown in the "Mi Bind Key" field. The key can be copied directly into the sensor YAML configuration.

.. figure:: images/telink_flasher.jpg
    :align: center
    :width: 100.0%

    Telink flasher application.

.. warning::

    The new bind key will work with ESPHome, but the Mi Home app will not recognise the sensor anymore once the device has been activated by the TeLink flasher application. To use the sensor again with the Xiaomi Mi Home app, the device needs to be removed and then re-added inside the Mi Home app.

CGDK2
*****

The method to obtain a new bind key for the CGDK2 sensor is similar to the method for the LYWSD03MMC sensor, except a modified version of the flasher application is used.

For this, you load the `application <https://zaluthar.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>`__ with a `supported browser <https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/master/implementation-status.md>`__ and connect the device by pressing "Connect". After the connection is established, you press the "Do Activation" button and the new key will be shown in the "Mi Bind Key" field. The key can be copied directly into the sensor YAML configuration.

Other encrypted devices
***********************

The easiest method (confirmed to work for LYWSD03MMC) is to use the `Telink flasher method <https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer>`__. The accompanying `video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKzFG61lNs>`_ shows how to wirelessly flash a LYWSD03MMC, or how to obtain the bind key of the stock firmware (watch till around 13:10). The custom firmware allows you to change several settings of the device, including the smiley and the advertising interval. Keep in mind that when flashing the custom firmware, you need to enable the 'Advertising Type' to be 'Mi Like' and to give ESPHome a dummy bind key, as it still expects one even though the custom firmware does not encrypt the data.

The other option is to use the original Mi Home app to add the sensor once. While adding the device, a new key is generated and uploaded into the Xiaomi cloud and to the device itself. Currently a chinese server needs to be selected as the rest of the world doesn't support most of these devices yet. Once generated, the key will not change again until the device is removed and re-added in the Xiaomi app.

In order to obtain the bind key, a SSL packet sniffer needs to be setup on either an Android phone or the iPhone. A good choice for Android is the `Remote PCAP <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.egorovandreyrm.pcapremote&hl=en>`__ in combination with `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`__. A tutorial on how to setup the Remote PCAP packet sniffer can be found `here <https://egorovandreyrm.com/pcap-remote-tutorial/>`__ and `here <https://github.com/ahpohl/xiaomi_lywsd03mmc>`__. Instructions how to obtain the key using an iPhone are `here <https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.mitemp_bt/blob/master/faq.md#my-sensors-ble-advertisements-are-encrypted-how-can-i-get-the-key>`__. Once the traffic between the Mi Home app and the Xiaomi servers has been recorded, the bind key will show in clear text:

.. code-block:: yaml

    packet: POST /app/device/bltbind

    "data" = "{"did":"blt.3.129q4nasgeg00","token":"20c665a7ff82a5bfb5eefc36","props":[{"type":"prop","key":"bind_key","value":"cfc7cc892f4e32f7a733086cf3443cb0"},   {"type":"prop","key":"smac","value":"A4:C1:38:8C:34:B7"}]}"

The ``bind_key`` is the 32 digits "value" item in the above output which needs to be inserted into the config file.
