Component
---------
.. _ld2415h-component:

The ``ld2415h`` sensor platform allows you to use the Hi-Link HLK-LD2415H velocity radar sensor 
with ESPHome to track the velocity of objects.  The sensor utilizes millimeter wave radar to 
measure the velocity of objects within it's field of view.

The :ref:`UART <uart>` is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

Select, and number components provide real-time configuration of the sensor during operation.

Platform
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

    ld2415h:

Configuration variables:
************************

**ld2415h** (*Required*): Component platform.


Number
------

.. code-block:: yaml

    number:
      - platform: ld2415h
        min_speed_threshold:
          name: Min Speed Threshold
        compensation_angle:
          name: Compensation Angle
        sensitivity:
          name: Sensitivity
        vibration_correction:
          name: Vibration Correction
        relay_trigger_duration:
          name: Relay Trigger Duration
        relay_trigger_speed:
          name: Relay Trigger Speed

Configuration variables:
************************

- **min_speed_threshold** (*Required*): Represents the minimum speed reported by the sensor. This allows you to filter out reports
  of slow moving objects.
- **compensation_angle** (*Required*): Compensation angle between the center of the radar beam axis and the travel direction of 
  objects.  This will compensate for angle not being perpendicular to the direction of travel of objects.
- **sensitivity** (*Required*): This adjusts the level of anti-interference compensation.  Higher values will result in fewer
  erroneous reports.
- **vibration_correction** (*Required*): Vibration anti-interference coefficient used to reject false positives.  For example if 
  the sensor is mounted to swaying pole.
- **relay_trigger_duration** (*Required*): The relay closure time when an object's speed exceeds the trigger speed.
- **relay_trigger_speed** (*Required*): The speed at which the relay will trigger.


Select
------

.. code-block:: yaml

    select:
      - platform: ld2415h
        sample_rate:
          name: Sample Rate
        tracking_mode:
          name: Tracking Mode

**Sample Rates:**

The select component allows you to choose between three sample rates: **~22 fps**, **~11 fps** and **~6 fps**.

**Tracking Modes:**

The UI provides three tracking modes: **Approaching and Restreating**, **Approaching** and **Restreating**.
The select component allows you to choose the active mode.

- **Approaching and Restreating**: This is the default mode. It will report the speed of any object moving toward or 
  away from the sensor.
- **Approaching**: In this mode the sensor will only report the speed of objects moving toward the sensor.
- **Restreating**: In this mode the sensor will only report the speed of objects moving away from the sensor.

Configuration variables:
************************

- **sample_rate** (*Required*): Provisions the sample rate select component.
  May contain any options from :ref:`Select <config-select>`.

- **tracking_mode** (*Required*): Provisions the tracking mode select component.
  May contain any options from :ref:`Select <config-select>`.

Sensor
------

The ``ld2415h`` sensor allows you to use your :doc:`ld2415h` to log the speed of objects moving within its field of
detection.  The sensor Antenna angle is 40° horizontal with a 16° pitch and can sense objects in front or behind.
The sensor will not report speeds below 1 KM/H.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: ld2415h
        speed:
          name: Speed

Configuration variables:
************************

- **speed** (*Optional*): The speed of the fastest moving object detected by the sensor. May contain any options
  from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.


Important Information
---------------------

This sensor does not maintain state between power cycles.  Because it is subject to environmental interference, 
it is recommended to configure the sensor after installation.
