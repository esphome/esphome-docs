    :description: Instructions for setting up the base fan component.
    :image: folder-open.svg

With the ``fan`` domain you can create components that appear as fans in
the Home Assistant frontend. A fan can be switched on or off, optionally
has a speed between 1 and the maximum supported speed of the fan, and can have an
oscillation and direction output.

.. _config-fan:

Base Fan Configuration
----------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    fan:
      - platform: ...
        name: ...

Configuration variables:

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the fan.

  .. note::

      If you have a :ref:`friendly_name <esphome-configuration_variables>` set for your device and
      you want the fan to use that name, you can set ``name: None``.

- **icon** (*Optional*, icon): Manually set the icon to use for the fan in the frontend.
- **restore_mode** (*Optional*): Control how the fan attempts to restore state on boot.

    - ``NO_RESTORE`` - Don't restore any state.
    - ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_OFF`` - Attempt to restore state and default to OFF if not possible to restore.
    - ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_ON`` - Attempt to restore state and default to ON.
    - ``RESTORE_INVERTED_DEFAULT_OFF`` - Attempt to restore state inverted from the previous state and default to OFF.
    - ``RESTORE_INVERTED_DEFAULT_ON`` - Attempt to restore state inverted from the previous state and default to ON.
    - ``ALWAYS_OFF`` (Default) - Always initialize the fan as OFF on bootup.
    - ``ALWAYS_ON`` - Always initialize the fan as ON on bootup.

- **internal** (*Optional*, boolean): Mark this component as internal. Internal components will
  not be exposed to the frontend (like Home Assistant). Only specifying an ``id`` without
  a ``name`` will implicitly set this to true.
- **disabled_by_default** (*Optional*, boolean): If true, then this entity should not be added to any client's frontend
  (usually Home Assistant) without the user manually enabling it (via the Home Assistant UI).
  Defaults to ``false``.
- **entity_category** (*Optional*, string): The category of the entity.
  See https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#generic-properties
  for a list of available options.
  Set to ``""`` to remove the default entity category.

MQTT options:

- **oscillation_state_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to
  publish fan oscillation state changes to.
- **oscillation_command_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to
  receive oscillation commands on.
- **speed_level_state_topic** (*Optional*, int): The topic to publish
  numeric fan speed state changes to (range: 0 to speed count).
- **speed_level_command_topic** (*Optional*, int): The topic to receive
  numeric speed commands on (range: 0 to speed count).
- **speed_state_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to publish fan
  speed state changes to (options: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
- **speed_command_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to receive
  speed commands on (options: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
- All other options from :ref:`MQTT Component <config-mqtt-component>`.

Automation triggers:

- **on_state** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan state is changed. See :ref:`fan-on_state_trigger`.
- **on_turn_on** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan is turned on. See :ref:`fan-on_turn_on_off_trigger`.
- **on_turn_off** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan is turned off. See :ref:`fan-on_turn_on_off_trigger`.
- **on_direction_set** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan direction is changed. See :ref:`fan-on_direction_set_trigger`.
- **on_oscillating_set** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan oscillating state is changed. See :ref:`fan-on_oscillating_set_trigger`.
- **on_speed_set** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan speed is changed. See :ref:`fan-on_speed_set_trigger`.
- **on_preset_set** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the fan preset mode is changed. See :ref:`fan-on_preset_set_trigger`.

.. _fan-toggle_action:

``fan.toggle`` Action
---------------------

Toggles the ON/OFF state of the fan with the given ID when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - fan.toggle: fan_1

.. _fan-turn_off_action:

``fan.turn_off`` Action
-----------------------

Turns the fan with the given ID off when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - fan.turn_off: fan_1

.. _fan-turn_on_action:

``fan.turn_on`` Action
----------------------

Turns the fan with the given ID on when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - fan.turn_on:
            id: fan_1
        # Shorthand:
        - fan.turn_on: fan_1

Configuration options:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the fan.
- **oscillating** (*Optional*, boolean, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`):
  Set the oscillation state of the fan. Defaults to not affecting oscillation.
- **speed** (*Optional*, int, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`):
  Set the speed level of the fan. Can be a number between 1 and the maximum speed level of the fan.
- **direction** (*Optional*, string, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`):

.. _fan-cycle_speed_action:

``fan.cycle_speed`` Action
--------------------------

Increments through speed levels of the fan with the given ID when executed. If the fan's speed level is set to maximum when executed, fan will cycle off unless ``off_speed_cycle`` is set to ``false``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - fan.cycle_speed:
            id: fan_1
            off_speed_cycle: true
        # Shorthand:
        - fan.cycle_speed: fan_1

Configuration options:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the fan.
- **off_speed_cycle** (*Optional*, boolean, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): Determines if the fan will cycle off after cycling though its highest speed. Can be ``true`` or ``false``. If ``false`` fan will cycle to its lowest speed instead of turning off.  Defaults to ``true``.

.. _fan-is_on_condition:
.. _fan-is_off_condition:

``fan.is_on`` / ``fan.is_off`` Condition
----------------------------------------

This :ref:`condition <config-condition>` passes if the given fan is on or off.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # in a trigger:
    on_...:
      if:
        condition:
          fan.is_on: my_fan
          # same goes for is_off
        then:
        - script.execute: my_script

.. _fan-on_state_trigger:

``fan.on_state`` Trigger
------------------------

This trigger is activated each time the fan state is changed. It will fire when the state is either set via API e.g. in Home Assistant or locally by an automation or a lambda function.
A pointer to the ``Fan`` is available as a variable called ``x``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fan:
      - platform: speed # or any other platform
        # ...
        on_state:
        - logger.log:

              args: [ x.c_str() ]

Lambda calls
------------

From :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can call several methods on all fans to do some
advanced stuff (see the full API Reference for more info).

- ``state``: Retrieve the current state (on/off) of the fan.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the fan state and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_fan).state) {
        // Fan is ON, do something here
      } else {
        // Fan is OFF, do something else here
      }

- ``speed``: Retrieve the current speed of the fan.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the fan speed and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_fan).speed == 2) {
        // Fan speed is 2, do something here
      } else {
        // Fan speed is not 2, do something else here
      }

- ``oscillating``: Retrieve the current oscillating state of the fan.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the fan oscillating state and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_fan).oscillating) {
        // Fan is oscillating, do something here
      } else {
        // Fan is not oscillating, do something else here
      }

- ``direction``: Retrieve the current direction of the fan.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the fan direction and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_fan).direction == FanDirection::FORWARD) {
        // Fan direction is forward, do something here
      } else {
        // Fan direction is reverse, do something else here
      }

- ``preset_mode``: Retrieve the current preset mode of the fan.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Within lambda, get the fan preset mode and conditionally do something
      if (id(my_fan).preset_mode == "auto") {
        // Fan preset mode is "auto", do something here
      } else {
        // Fan preset mode is not "auto", do something else here
      }

- ``turn_off()``/``turn_on()``/``toggle()``: Manually turn the fan ON/OFF from code.
  Similar to the ``fan.turn_on``, ``fan.turn_off``, and ``fan.toggle`` actions,
  but can be used in complex lambda expressions.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      // Turn the fan off
      auto call = id(my_fan).turn_off();
      call.perform();

      // Turn the fan on and set the speed, oscillating, and direction
      auto call = id(my_fan).turn_on();
      call.set_speed(2);
      call.set_oscillating(true);
      call.set_direction(FanDirection::REVERSE);
      call.perform();

      // Set a preset mode
      auto call = id(my_fan).turn_on();
      call.set_preset_mode("auto");
      call.perform();

      // Toggle the fan on/off
      auto call = id(my_fan).toggle();
      call.perform();
