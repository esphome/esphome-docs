ESPHome devices with a microphone are able to stream the audio to Home Assistant and be processed there by `assist <https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/>`__.

.. note::

    Voice Assistant requires Home Assistant 2023.5 or later.

Configuration:
--------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    microphone:
      - platform: ...
        id: mic_id

    voice_assistant:
      microphone: mic_id

- **microphone** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The :doc:`microphone </components/microphone/index>` to use for input.
- **speaker** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The :doc:`speaker </components/speaker/index>` to use to output the response.
  Cannot be used with ``media_player`` below.
- **media_player** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The :doc:`media_player </components/media_player/index>` to use
  to output the response. Cannot be used with ``speaker`` above.
- **silence_detection** (*Optional*, bool): Whether Home Assistant uses Voice Activity Detection to detect when you
  have stopped talking and start processing the command. Defaults to ``true``.
- **on_listening** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to

  when the voice assistant has finished speech-to-text. The resulting text is
  available to automations as the variable ``x``.
- **on_tts_start** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the voice assistant has started text-to-speech. The text to be spoken is
  available to automations as the variable ``x``.
- **on_tts_end** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
