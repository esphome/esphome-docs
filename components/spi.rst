SPI is a very common high-speed protocol for a lot of devices. The SPI bus usually consists of 4 wires:

- **CLK**: Is used to tell the receiving device when to read data. All devices on the bus can
  share this line. Sometimes also called ``SCK``.
- **CS** (chip select): Is used to tell the receiving device when it should listen for data. Each device has
  an individual CS line. Sometimes also called ``SS``. If the SPI bus has a single device, its CS pin
  can sometimes be connected to ground to tell it that it is always selected.
- **MOSI** (also DIN): Is used to send data from the master (the ESP) to the receiving device. All devices on the bus can
  share this line.
- **MISO** (also DOUT): Is used to receive data. All devices on the bus can
  share this line.

In some cases one of **MOSI** or **MISO** do not exist as the receiving device only accepts data or sends data.

To set up SPI devices in ESPHome, you first need to place a top-level SPI hub like below which defines what pins to
use for the functions described above. The **CS** pins are then individually managed by the components. The ``spi:``
component also accepts a list of buses if you want to have multiple SPI buses with your ESP (though this should
rarely be necessary, as the SPI bus can be shared by the devices).

    # Example configuration entry
    spi:
      clk_pin: GPIO14
      mosi_pin: GPIO13
      miso_pin: GPIO12

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **clk_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin used for the clock line of the SPI bus.
- **mosi_pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin used for the MOSI line of the SPI bus.
- **miso_pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The pin used for the MISO line of the SPI bus.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID for this SPI hub if you need multiple SPI hubs.
