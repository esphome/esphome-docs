Improv via BLE

    :description: Instructions for setting up Improv via BLE in ESPHome.
    :image: improv-social.png

The ``esp32_improv`` component in ESPHome implements the open `Improv standard <https://www.improv-wifi.com/>`__
for configuring Wi-Fi on an ESP32 device by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to receive the credentials.

The ``esp32_improv`` component will automatically set up the :doc:`BLE Server <esp32_ble>`.

.. warning::

    The BLE software stack on the ESP32 consumes a significant amount of RAM on the device.
    
    **Crashes are likely to occur** if you include too many additional components in your device's
    configuration. Memory-intensive components such as :doc:`/components/voice_assistant` and other
    audio components are most likely to cause issues.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    wifi:
      # ...

    esp32_improv:
      authorizer: binary_sensor_id


Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **authorizer** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): A :doc:`binary sensor <binary_sensor/index>` to authorize with.
  Also accepts ``none``/``false`` to skip authorization.
- **authorized_duration** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The amount of time until authorization times out and needs
  to be re-authorized. Defaults to ``1min``.
- **status_indicator** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): An :doc:`output <output/index>` to display feedback to the user.
- **identify_duration** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The amount of time to identify for. Defaults to ``10s``.
- **wifi_timeout** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The amount of time to wait before starting the Improv service
  after Wi-Fi is no longer connected. Defaults to ``1min``.
- **on_start** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation<automation>`): An action to be performed when Improv is waiting for
  authorization and/or upon authorization. See :ref:`improv-on_start`.
- **on_provisioned** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation<automation>`): An action to be performed when provisioning has
  completed. See :ref:`improv-on_provisioned`.
- **on_provisioning** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation<automation>`): An action to be performed when the device begins the
  provisioning process. See :ref:`improv-on_provisioning`.
- **on_stop** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation<automation>`): An action to be performed when Improv has stopped.
  See :ref:`improv-on_stop`.
- **on_state** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation<automation>`): An action to be performed when an Improv state change
  happens. See :ref:`improv-on_state`.

Improv Automations
------------------

The ESP32 Improv component provides various :ref:`automations <automation>` that can be used to provide feedback during
the Improv provisioning process.

.. _improv-on_start:

``on_start``
************

This automation will be triggered when the device is waiting for authorization (usually by pressing a button on the
device, if configured -- see ``authorizer`` above) and/or upon authorization.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_improv:
      on_start:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Improv awaiting authorization/authorized"

.. _improv-on_provisioned:

``on_provisioned``
******************

This automation will be triggered when provisioning has completed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_improv:
      on_provisioned:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Improv provisioned"

.. _improv-on_provisioning:

``on_provisioning``
*******************

This automation will be triggered when provisioning begins.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_improv:
      on_provisioning:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Improv provisioning"

.. _improv-on_stop:

``on_stop``
***********

This automation will be triggered when Improv has stopped.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_improv:
      on_stop:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Improv stopped"

.. _improv-on_state:

``on_state``
************

This automation will be triggered on every state change.

Two variables are available for use in :ref:`lambdas<config-lambda>` within this automation. They are:

- ``state``, an ``enum`` named ``improv::State``, having one of the following values:

  -  ``improv::STATE_STOPPED``
  -  ``improv::STATE_AWAITING_AUTHORIZATION``
  -  ``improv::STATE_AUTHORIZED``
  -  ``improv::STATE_PROVISIONING``
  -  ``improv::STATE_PROVISIONED``

- ``error``, an ``enum`` named ``improv::Error``, having one of the following values:

  -  ``improv::ERROR_NONE``
  -  ``improv::ERROR_INVALID_RPC``
  -  ``improv::ERROR_UNKNOWN_RPC``
  -  ``improv::ERROR_UNABLE_TO_CONNECT``
  -  ``improv::ERROR_NOT_AUTHORIZED``
  -  ``improv::ERROR_UNKNOWN``

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_improv:
      on_state:
        then:
          - if:
              condition:
                lambda: return state == improv::STATE_AUTHORIZED;
              then:
                - logger.log: "Improv state is STATE_AUTHORIZED"

Status Indicator
----------------

The ``status_indicator`` has the following patterns:

- solid: The improv service is active and waiting to be authorized.
- blinking once per second: The improv service is awaiting credentials.
- blinking 3 times per second with a break in between: The identify command has been used by the client.
- blinking 5 times per second: Credentials are being verified and saved to the device.
- off: The improv service is not running.
