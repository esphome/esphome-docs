The ``homeassistant`` number platform allows you to create a number that is synchronized
with Home Assistant. Min, Max and Step are not configurable for this platform because they are taken from the Home Assistant entity.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    number:
      - platform: homeassistant
        id: my_ha_number
        entity_id: number.my_number

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **entity_id** (**Required**, string): The Home Assistant entity ID of the number to synchronize with.
- All other options from :ref:`Number <config-number>`.

``number.set`` Action
---------------------

You can also set the number for the Home Assistant number from elsewhere in your YAML file
with the :ref:`number-set_action`.
