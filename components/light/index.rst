    :description: Instructions for setting up lights and light effects in ESPHome.
    :image: folder-open.svg

The ``light`` domain in ESPHome lets you create lights that will
automatically be shown in Home Assistantâ€™s frontend and have many
features such as RGB colors, transitions, flashing and effects.

This component restores its state on reboot/reset.

.. _config-light:

Base Light Configuration
------------------------

All light configuration schemas inherit these options.

.. code-block:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...


Configuration variables:

- **id** (*Optional*, string): Manually specify the ID for code generation. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.
- **name** (*Optional*, string): The name of the light. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.

  .. note::

      If you have a :ref:`friendly_name <esphome-configuration_variables>` set for your device and
      you want the light to use that name, you can set ``name: None``.

- **icon** (*Optional*, icon): Manually set the icon to use for the light in the frontend.
- **effects** (*Optional*, list): A list of :ref:`light effects <light-effects>` to use for this light.
- **gamma_correct** (*Optional*, float): Apply a `gamma correction
  factor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction>`__ to the light channels.
  Defaults to ``2.8``.
- **default_transition_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The default transition length
  to use when no transition length is set in the light call. Defaults to ``1s``.
- **flash_transition_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The transition length to use when flash
  is called. Defaults to ``0s``.
- **restore_mode** (*Optional*): Control how the light attempts to restore state on bootup.

    - ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_OFF`` - Attempt to restore state and default to OFF if not possible to restore.
    - ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_ON`` - Attempt to restore state and default to ON.
    - ``RESTORE_INVERTED_DEFAULT_OFF`` - Attempt to restore state inverted from the previous state and default to OFF.
    - ``RESTORE_INVERTED_DEFAULT_ON`` - Attempt to restore state inverted from the previous state and default to ON.
    - ``RESTORE_AND_OFF`` - Attempt to restore state but initialize the light as OFF.
    - ``RESTORE_AND_ON`` - Attempt to restore state but initialize the light as ON.
    - ``ALWAYS_OFF`` (Default) - Always initialize the light as OFF on bootup.
    - ``ALWAYS_ON`` - Always initialize the light as ON on bootup.

- **on_turn_on** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the light is turned on. See :ref:`light-on_turn_on_off_trigger`.
- **on_turn_off** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the light is turned off. See :ref:`light-on_turn_on_off_trigger`.
- **on_state** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the light's set state is changed. See :ref:`light-on_state_trigger`.

Additional configuration variables for addressable lights:

- **color_correct** (*Optional*, list of float): Apply a color correction to each color channel.
  This defines the maximum brightness of each channel. For example ``[100%, 50%, 100%]`` would set the
  green channel to be at most at 50% brightness.
- **power_supply** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The :doc:`/components/power_supply` to connect to
  this light. When the light is turned on, the power supply will automatically be switched on too.

Advanced options:

- **internal** (*Optional*, boolean): Mark this component as internal. Internal components will
  not be exposed to the frontend (like Home Assistant). Only specifying an ``id`` without
  a ``name`` will implicitly set this to true.
- **disabled_by_default** (*Optional*, boolean): If true, then this entity should not be added to any client's frontend,
  (usually Home Assistant) without the user manually enabling it (via the Home Assistant UI).
  Defaults to ``false``.
- **entity_category** (*Optional*, string): The category of the entity.
  See https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#generic-properties
  for a list of available options.
  Set to ``""`` to remove the default entity category.
- If MQTT enabled, all other options from :ref:`MQTT Component <config-mqtt-component>`.
- If Webserver enabled and version 3 is selected, All other options from Webserver Component.. See :ref:`Webserver Version 3 <config-webserver-version-3-options>`.

.. _light-toggle_action:

``light.toggle`` Action
***********************

This action toggles a light with the given ID when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - light.toggle:
            id: light_1
        # Shorthand:
        - light.toggle: light_1

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the light.
- **transition_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The length of the transition
  if the light supports it.

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(light_1).toggle();
        // perform action:
        call.perform();

.. _light-turn_on_action:

``light.turn_on`` Action
************************

This action turns a light with the given ID on when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - light.turn_on:
            id: light_1
            brightness: 100%
            red: 100%
            green: 100%
            blue: 1.0

        # Templated
        - light.turn_on:
            id: light_1
            brightness: !lambda |-
              // output value must be in range 0 - 1.0
              return id(some_sensor).state / 100.0;

        # Shorthand
        - light.turn_on: light_1

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the light.
- **transition_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The length of the transition
  if the light supports it.
- **color_mode** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): For lights that support more than one color mode, the color
  mode that will be activated. The color mode determines which outputs of the light are active, and which parameters can be used.
  This can for example be used to switch between colored and white light. Must be a color mode that is supported by the light.
  Valid color modes are:

    - ``ON_OFF``: Only on/off control.
    - ``BRIGHTNESS``: Only brightness control. Accepts *brightness* parameter.
    - ``WHITE``: Single white channel only. Accepts *brightness* and *white* parameters.
    - ``COLOR_TEMPERATURE``: Color-temperature controlled white channel. Accepts *brightness* and *color_temperature*
      parameters.
    - ``COLD_WARM_WHITE``: Cold and warm white channels. Accepts *brightness*, *color_temperature*, *cold_white* and
      *warm_white* parameters.
    - ``RGB``: RGB color channels. Accepts *brightness*, *color_brightness*, *red*, *green* and *blue* parameters.
    - ``RGB_WHITE``: RGB color channels and a separate white channel. Accepts parameters from ``RGB`` and ``WHITE``
      color modes.
    - ``RGB_COLOR_TEMPERATURE``: RGB color channels and a separate color-temperature controlled white channel. Accepts
      parameters from ``RGB`` and ``COLOR_TEMPERATURE`` color modes.
    - ``RGB_COLD_WARM_WHITE``: RGB color channels and two separate cold and warm white channels. Accepts parameters
      from ``RGB`` and ``COLD_WARM_WHITE`` color modes.

- **brightness** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The master brightness of the light, that
  applies to all channels (both color and white) of the light.
- **color_brightness** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The brightness of the color lights. Useful
  to control brightness of colored and white lights separately for RGBW lights.
- **red** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The red channel of the light.
- **green** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The green channel of the light.
- **blue** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The blue channel of the light.
- **white** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The brightness of the white channel.
- **color_temperature** (*Optional*, float, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The color temperature
  (in `mireds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mired>`__ or Kelvin) of the white channel.
- **cold_white** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The brightness of the cold white channel.
  Cannot be used at the same time as *color_temperature*.
- **warm_white** (*Optional*, percentage, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The brightness of the warm white channel.
  Cannot be used at the same time as *color_temperature*.
- **flash_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): If set, will flash the given color
  for this period of time and then go back to the previous state.
- **effect** (*Optional*, string, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): If set, will attempt to
  start an effect with the given name.

All percentage options accept values in the range ``0%`` to ``100%`` or ``0.0`` to ``1.0``, and default to not changing
the current value (which might be the value from before the light was last turned off). To reset values, explicitly set
them to zero.

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(light_1).turn_on();
        // set parameters (optional)
        call.set_transition_length(1000); // in ms
        call.set_brightness(1.0); // 1.0 is full brightness
        call.set_color_mode(ColorMode::RGB_COLD_WARM_WHITE);
        call.set_rgb(0.5, 0.25, 1.0); // color in RGB order, this example is purple
        call.set_cold_white(0.5);
        call.set_warm_white(0.75);
        call.set_effect("The Effect");
        // perform action:
        call.perform();

    Shorter example using auto call , call.set_brightness and call.perform.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        id(light_1).turn_on().set_brightness(1.0).perform();


.. note::

    The ``red``, ``green`` and ``blue`` values only control the color of the light, not its
    brightness! If you assign ``50%`` to all RGB channels it will be interpreted as 100% on.
    Only use ``brightness`` or ``color_brightness`` to control the brightness of the light.

.. note::

    The master brightness (``brightness``) and separate brightness controls for the color and
    white channels (``color_brightness``, ``white``, ``cold_white`` and ``warm_white``) are
    multiplied together. Thus, this will result in color at 40% brightness and white at 60%
    brightness:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - light.turn_on:
            id: light_1
            brightness: 80%
            color_brightness: 50%
            white: 75%

.. _light-turn_off_action:

``light.turn_off`` Action
*************************

This action turns a light with the given ID off when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - light.turn_off:
            id: light_1

        # Shorthand
        - light.turn_off: light_1

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the light.
- **transition_length** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`): The length of the transition
  if the light supports it.

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(light_1).turn_off();
        // set parameters (optional)
        call.set_transition_length(1000); // in ms
        // perform action:
        call.perform();

.. _light-control_action:

``light.control`` Action
************************

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` is a generic call to change the state of a light - it
is essentially just a combination of the turn_on and turn_off calls.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - light.control:
            id: light_1
            state: on

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to dim a light that supports brightness
by a relative amount.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:

        # Increases the brightness by 5%
        - light.dim_relative:
            id: light_1
            relative_brightness: 5%

.. note::

    Example: dimming a light with a button press

    .. code-block:: yaml

        binary_sensor:
          - platform: gpio

                    binary_sensor.is_on: my_binary_sensor
                  then:
                    - light.dim_relative:
                        id: light_1
                        relative_brightness: 5%

to a specific color.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - light.addressable_set:
          id: my_light
          range_from: 0
          range_to: 50
          red: 100%
          green: 0%
          blue: 0%

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the addressable light to control.
- **range_from** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, int): The beginning
  of the range of LEDs to control, inclusive, using zero-based indexing. Defaults to 0 (the beginning of the strip).
- **range_to** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, int): The end of the
  range of LEDs to control, inclusive, using zero-based indexing.
  Defaults to the end of the strip (``num_leds`` - 1).
- **color_brightness** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, percentage): The brightness to
  set the color channel to.
- **red** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, percentage): The value to
  set the red channel to.
- **green** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, percentage): The value to
  set the green channel to.
- **blue** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, percentage): The value to
  set the blue channel to.
- **white** (*Optional*, :ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, percentage): The brightness to

.. _light-is_on_condition:
.. _light-is_off_condition:

``light.is_on`` / ``light.is_off`` Condition
********************************************

This :ref:`Condition <config-condition>` checks if the given light is ON or OFF. OFF means
that the light is completely OFF, and ON means that the light is emitting at least a bit of light.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # In some trigger:
    on_...:
      if:
        condition:
          # Same syntax for is_off
          light.is_on: my_light


.. _light-on_turn_on_off_trigger:

``light.on_turn_on`` / ``light.on_turn_off`` Trigger
****************************************************

This trigger is activated each time the light is turned on or off. It is consistent
with the behavior of the ``light.is_on`` and ``light.is_off`` condition above.

.. code-block:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: binary # or any other platform
        # ...
        on_turn_on:
        - logger.log: "Light Turned On!"
        on_turn_off:
        - logger.log: "Light Turned Off!"

.. _light-on_state_trigger:

``light.on_state`` Trigger
**************************

This trigger is activated each time the set light state is changed. It is not triggered
based on current state, but rather, it triggers on the set state which can differ from
the current state due to transitions. For example, the ``light.on_state`` trigger can
be used for immediate action when the light is set to off; while ``light.on_turn_off``
does not trigger until the light actually achieves the off state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: binary # or any other platform
        # ...
        on_state:
        - logger.log: "Light State Changed!"

.. _light-effects:

Light Effects
-------------

ESPHome also offers a bunch of light effects you can use for your lights. The defaults for the
effect parameters are made to work well on their own but of course ESPHome gives you the option to manually change
these parameters.

With ESPHome's light effects system you're basically creating a bunch of entries for the effects dropdown in
Home Assistant. If you wish to have several variants of the same effect you can of course also create multiple
entries with each having a unique name like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...
        # ...
        effects:
          # Use default parameters:
          - random:
          # Customize parameters
          - random:
              name: "My Slow Random Effect"
              transition_length: 30s
              update_interval: 30s
          - random:
              name: "My Fast Random Effect"
              transition_length: 4s
              update_interval: 5s

.. note::

    After setting a light effect, it is possible to reset the in-use effect back to a static light by setting the ``effect`` to ``none`` when it is being called through Home Assistant or directly on the device.

Pulse Effect
************

This effect makes a pulsating light. The period can be defined by ``update_interval``, the transition length with ``transition_length``. ``transition_length`` should be set to less than ``update_interval``, setting ``transition_length`` to ``1s`` and ``update_interval`` to ``2s`` will result in a transition from 0% to 100% lasting 1 second, 1 second full light, a transition from 100% to 0% for 1 second and off for 1 second.

.. code-block:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...
        # ...
        effects:
          - pulse:
          - pulse:

              # transition_length: 1s      # defaults to 1s
              update_interval: 2s
          - pulse:
              name: "Asymmetrical Pulse"
              transition_length:
                on_length: 1s

E1.31 Effect
************

This effect enables controlling addressable lights using UDP-based
E1.31_ protocol.

For Example JINX_ or Hyperion.NG_ could be used to control E1.31_ enabled ESPHome.

.. code-block:: yaml

    e131:
      method: multicast # default: register E1.31 to Multicast group

    light:
      - platform: neopixelbus
        num_leds: 189
        effects:
          - e131:
              universe: 1
              channels: RGB

Configuration variables:

- **universe** (**Required**, int): The value of universe, between 1 to 512.
- **channels** (*Optional*): The type of data. This is used to specify if it is a ``MONO``,
  ``RGB`` or ``RGBW`` light and in which order the colors are. Defaults to ``RGB``.

There are three modes of operation:

- ``MONO``: this supports 1 channel per LED (luminance), up-to 512 LEDs per universe
- ``RGB``: this supports 3 channels per LED (RGB), up-to 170 LEDs (3*170 = 510 bytes) per universe
- ``RGBW``: this supports 4 channels per LED (RGBW), up-to 128 LEDs (4*128 = 512 bytes) per universe

If there's more LEDs than allowed per-universe, additional universe will be used.
In the above example of 189 LEDs, first 170 LEDs will be assigned to 1 universe,
the rest of 19 LEDs will be automatically assigned to 2 universe.

It is possible to enable multiple light platforms to listen to the same universe concurrently,
allowing to replicate the behaviour on multiple strips.
