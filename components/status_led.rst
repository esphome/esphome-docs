    :description: Instructions for setting up status LEDs in ESPHome to monitor the status of an ESP.
    :image: led-on.svg

The ``status_led`` hooks into all ESPHome components and can indicate the status of
the device. Specifically, it will:

- Blink slowly (about every second) when a **warning** is active. Warnings are active when for
  example reading a sensor value fails temporarily, the WiFi/MQTT connections are disrupted, or 
  if the native API component is included but no client is connected.
- Blink quickly (multiple times per second) when an **error** is active. Errors indicate that
  ESPHome has found an error while setting up. In most cases, ESPHome will still try to
  recover from the error and continue with all other operations.
- Stay off otherwise.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    status_led:
      pin: GPIO2

.. note::

    If your device has a single LED that needs to be shared use  :doc:`status_led light platform </components/light/status_led>` instead.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The
  GPIO pin to operate the status LED on.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

.. note::

    If your LED is in an active-LOW mode (when it's on if the output is enabled), use the
    ``inverted`` option of the :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        status_led:
          pin:
            number: D0
            inverted: true
