    :description: Instructions for setting up Waveshare E-Paper displays in ESPHome.
    :image: waveshare_epaper.jpg

The ``waveshare_epaper`` display platform allows you to use
some E-Paper displays sold by `Waveshare <https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper.htm>`__
with ESPHome. The 2.13" `TTGO module <https://github.com/lewisxhe/TTGO-EPaper-Series>`__ with an ESP32 on the board 
is supported as well. Depending on your specific revision of the board you might need to try out the ``-b73`` or ``-b1`` 
version (see below).
The 1.54" `Good Display gdew0154m09 <https://www.good-display.com/product/206.html>`__ 
as used in the `M5Stack Core Ink <https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display>`__
is also supported.
Similar modules sold by other vendors might also work but not have been tested yet. Currently only
single-color E-Ink displays are implemented and of those only a few modules.

    Waveshare E-Paper 2.9 Inch E-Paper Display.

The communication ESPHome has chosen to use for this integration is 4-wire :ref:`SPI <spi>`, as it's the most stable
and high-speed. So you need to make sure your board is set to the 4-wire SPI mode and have an ``spi:`` section in your
configuration.

.. warning::

    The BUSY pin on the gdew0154m09 and Waveshare 7.50in V2 models must be inverted to prevent permanent display damage. Set the pin to 
    ``inverted: true`` in the config. 

- **busy_pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The BUSY pin. Defaults to not connected.
- **reset_pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The RESET pin. Defaults to not connected.
  Make sure you pull this pin high (by connecting it to 3.3V with a resistor) if not connected to a GPIO pin.
  The B74 display variant requires the reset pin.
- **rotation** (*Optional*): Set the rotation of the display. Everything you draw in ``lambda:`` will be rotated
  by this option. One of ``0째`` (default), ``90째``, ``180째``, ``270째``.
- **full_update_every** (*Optional*, int): E-Paper displays have two modes of switching to the next image: A partial
  update that only changes the pixels that have changed and a full update mode that first clears the entire display
  and then re-draws the image. The former is much quicker and nicer, but every so often a full update needs to happen
  because artifacts accumulate. On the ``1.54in``, ``1.54inv2``, ``2.13in``, ``2.90in`` and ``2.90inv2`` models you have the option to switch only
  do a full-redraw every x-th time using this option. Defaults to ``30`` on the described models and a full update for
  all other models.
- **reset_duration** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): Duration for the display reset operation. Defaults to ``200ms``.
  Setting this value to ``2ms`` may resolve issues with newer e-Paper Driver modules (e.g. Rev 2.1).
- **lambda** (*Optional*, :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>`): The lambda to use for rendering the content on the display.
  See :ref:`display-engine` for more information.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to re-draw the screen. Defaults to ``1s``, use ``never`` to only manually update the screen via ``component.update``.
- **pages** (*Optional*, list): Show pages instead of a single lambda. See :ref:`display-pages`.
- **spi_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID of the :ref:`SPI Component <spi>` if you want
  to use multiple SPI buses.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
