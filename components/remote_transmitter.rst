    :description: Instructions for setting up switches that send out pre-defined sequences of IR or RF signals
    :image: remote.svg
    :keywords: Infrared, IR, RF, Remote, TX

The ``remote_transmitter`` component lets you send digital packets to control
devices in your home. For example this includes infrared data or 433MHz RF signals.

First, you need to setup a global hub that specifies which pin your remote
sender is connected to. Then you can use the available actions to send encoded
remote signals.

**See** :ref:`remote-setting-up-infrared` **and** :ref:`remote-setting-up-rf` **for set up guides.**

.. note::

    This component is more accurate on the ESP32, since that chipset has a dedicated
    peripheral for sending exact signal sequences.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

Configuration variables:
------------------------

-  **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin to transmit the remote signal on.
-  **carrier_duty_percent** (*Optional*, int): How much of the time the remote is on. For example, infrared
   protocols modulate the signal using a carrier signal. Set this to ``50%`` if you're working with IR LEDs and to
   ``100%`` if working with other things like 433MHz transmitters.
- **rmt_channel** (*Optional*, int): The RMT channel to use. Only on **esp32**.
  The following ESP32 variants have these channels available:

  .. csv-table::
      :header: "ESP32 Variant", "Channels"

      "ESP32", "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7"
      "ESP32-S2", "0, 1, 2, 3"
      "ESP32-S3", "0, 1, 2, 3"
      "ESP32-C3", "0, 1"

-  **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify
   the ID used for code generation. Use this if you have multiple remote transmitters.

.. _remote_transmitter-transmit_action:

Remote Transmitter Actions
--------------------------

Remote transmitters support a number of :ref:`actions <config-action>` that can be used
to send remote codes. All supported protocols are listed below. All actions additionally
have these configuration variables:

.. code-block::yaml

    on_...:
      - remote_transmitter.transmit_x:
          # ...
          repeat:
            times: 5
            wait_time: 10ms

Configuration variables:

- **repeat** (*Optional*): Optionally set the code to be repeated a number of times.
  Defaults to sending the code only once.

  - **times** (int): The number of times to repeat the code.
  - **wait_time** (:ref:`config-time`): The time to wait between repeats.

- **transmitter_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The remote transmitter to send the
  remote code with. Defaults to the first one defined in the configuration.

If you're looking for the same functionality as is default in the ``rpi_rf`` integration in
Home Assistant, you'll want to set the **times** to 10 and the **wait_time** to 0s.

.. _remote_transmitter-transmit_abbwelcome:

``remote_transmitter.transmit_abbwelcome`` Action
*************************************************

This :ref:`action <config-action>` sends a ABB-Welcome message to the intercom bus. The
message type, addresses, address length and data can vary a lot between ABB-Welcome
systems. Please refer to the received messages while performing actions like ringing a
doorbell or opening a door.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - remote_transmitter.transmit_abbwelcome:
          source_address: 0x1001 # your indoor station address
          destination_address: 0x4001 # door address
          three_byte_address: false # address length of your system
          message_type: 0x0d # unlock door, on some systems 0x0e is used instead
          data: [0xab, 0xcd, 0xef]  # message data, see receiver dump

Configuration variables:

- **source_address** (**Required**, int):The source address to send the command from,
  see received messages for more info. For indoor stations the last byte of the address
  represents the apartment number set by the dials on the back of the indoor station and is
  transmitted in hexadecimal format.
- **destination_address** (**Required**, int): The destination address to send the command to,
  see received messages for more info.
- **three_byte_address** (**Required**, int): The destination address to send the command to,
  see received messages for more info.
- **three_byte_address** (**Optional**, boolean): The length of the source and destination address. ``false``
  means two bytes and ``true`` means three bytes. Please check the received messages to see which address length
  is used by your system. For example, ``[XXXX > XXXX]`` appears in the receiver log for two byte addresses and
  ``[XXXXXX > XXXXXX]`` for three byte addresses. Defaults to ``false``.
- **retransmission** (**Optional**, boolean): Should only be ``true`` if this message has been transmitted
  before with the same ``message_id``. Typically, messages are transmitted up to three times with a 1 second
  interval if no reply is received. Defaults to ``false``.
- **message_type** (**Required**, int): The message type, see dumper output for more info.
  The highest bit indicates a reply.
- **message_id** (**Optional**, int): The message ID, see dumper output for more info.
  Defaults to a randomly generated ID if this message is not a reply or retransmission.
- **data** (**Optional**, 0-7 bytes list): The code to send.
  Usually you only need to copy this directly from the dumper output. Defaults to ``[]``

.. note::

    ABB-Welcome messages are sent over the two-wire bus of your intercom system.
    A custom receiver and transmitter circuit is required.

``remote_transmitter.transmit_nec`` Action
******************************************

This :ref:`action <config-action>` sends an NEC infrared remote code to a remote transmitter.

.. note::

    In version 2021.12, the order of transferring bits was corrected from MSB to LSB in accordance with the NEC standard.
    Therefore, if the configuration file has come from an earlier version of ESPhome, it is necessary to reverse the order of the address and command bits when moving to 2021.12 or above.
    For example, address: 0x84ED, command: 0x13EC becomes 0xB721 and 0x37C8 respectively.
    Additionally, ESPHome does not automatically generate parity bits or pad values to 2 bytes.
    So, in order to send command 0x0, you need to use 0xFF00 (0x00 being the command and 0xFF being the logical inverse).

      call.perform();


.. _remote-setting-up-infrared:

Setting up Infrared Devices
---------------------------

In this guide an infrared device will be set up with ESPHome. First, the remote code
will be captured with an IR receiver module (like `this one <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266>`__).
We will use ESPHome's dumping ability to output the decoded remote code directly.

Then we will set up a new remote transmitter with an infrared LED (like
`this one <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ir-communication/all>`__) to transmit the
code when a switch is triggered.

First, connect the infrared receiver module to a pin on your board and set up a
remote_receiver instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIOXX
      dump: all

Compile and upload the code. While viewing the log output from the ESP,
press a button on an infrared remote you want to capture (one at a time).

You should see log output like below:

.. code-block:: text

    # If the codec is known:
    [D][remote.panasonic] Received Panasonic: address=0x4004 command=0x8140DFA2

    # Or raw output if it's not known yet
    # The values may fluctuate a bit, but as long as they're similar it's ok
    [D][remote.raw] Received Raw: 4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
    [D][remote.raw]   -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
    [D][remote.raw]   1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022

If the codec is already implemented in ESPHome, you will see the decoded value directly -
otherwise you will see the raw data dump (which you can use just as well). You have
just successfully captured your first infrared code.

Now let's use this information to emulate a button press from the ESP. First, wire up the
IR diode to a new pin on the ESP and configure a global ``remote_transmitter`` instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      # Infrared remotes use a 50% carrier signal
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

This will allow us to send any data we want via the IR LED. To replicate the codes we decoded
earlier, create a new template switch that sends the infrared code when triggered:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: template
        name: Panasonic Power Button
        turn_on_action:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_panasonic:
              address: 0x4004
              command: 0x8140DFA2

    # Or for raw code
    switch:
      - platform: template
        name: Raw Code Power Button
        turn_on_action:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_raw:
              carrier_frequency: 38kHz
              code: [4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
                     -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
                     1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022]

Recompile again, when you power up the device the next time you will see a new switch
in the frontend. Click on it and you should see the remote signal being transmitted. Done!

.. _remote-setting-up-rf:

Setting Up RF Devices
---------------------

The ``remote_transmitter`` and ``remote_receiver`` components can also be used to send
and receive 433MHz RF signals. This guide will discuss setting up a 433MHz receiver to
capture a device's remote codes. After that we will set up a 433MHz transmitter to replicate
the remote code with the press of a switch in the frontend.

First, connect the RF module to a pin on the ESP and set up a remote_receiver instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIOXX
      dump: all
      # Settings to optimize recognition of RF devices
      tolerance: 50%
      filter: 250us
      idle: 4ms
      buffer_size: 2kb

Compile and upload the code. While viewing the log output from the ESP,
press a button on an RF remote you want to capture (one at a time).

You should see log output like below:

.. code-block:: text

    # If the codec is known:
    [D][remote.rc_switch] Received RCSwitch: protocol=2 data='100010000000000010111110'

    # Or raw output if it's not known yet
    # The values may fluctuate a bit, but as long as they're similar it's ok
    [D][remote.raw] Received Raw: 4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
    [D][remote.raw]   -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
    [D][remote.raw]   1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022

.. note::

    If the log output is flooded with "Received Raw" messages, you can also disable raw
    remote code reporting and rely on rc_switch to decode the values.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        remote_receiver:
          pin: GPIOXX
          dump:
            - rc_switch
          tolerance: 50%
          filter: 250us
          idle: 4ms
          buffer_size: 2kb

If the codec is already implemented in ESPHome, you will see the decoded value directly -
otherwise you will see the raw data dump (which you can use just as well). You have
just successfully captured your first RF code.

Now let's use this information to emulate a button press from the ESP. First, wire up the
RF transmitter to a new pin on the ESP and configure a global ``remote_transmitter`` instance:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      # RF uses a 100% carrier signal
      carrier_duty_percent: 100%

This will allow us to send any data we want via the RF transmitter. To replicate the codes we decoded
earlier, create a new template switch that sends the RF code when triggered:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: template
        name: RF Power Button
        optimistic: true
        turn_on_action:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_rc_switch_raw:
              code: '100010000000000010111110'
              protocol: 2
              repeat:
                times: 10
                wait_time: 0s


    # Or for raw code
    switch:
      - platform: template
        name: Raw Code Power Button
        turn_on_action:
          - remote_transmitter.transmit_raw:
              code: [4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
                     -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
                     1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022]

Recompile again, when you power up the device the next time you will see a new switch
in the frontend. Click on it and you should see the remote signal being transmitted. Done!

.. note::

    Some devices require that the transmitted code be repeated for the signal to be picked up
    as valid. Also the interval between repetitions can be important. Check that the pace of
    repetition logs are consistent between the remote controller and the transmitter node.
    You can adjust the ``repeat:`` settings accordingly.
