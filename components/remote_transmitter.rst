    :description: Instructions for setting up configurations that send out pre-defined sequences of IR or RF signals
    :image: remote.svg
    :keywords: Infrared, IR, RF, Remote, TX, 433, Blaster

The ``remote_transmitter`` component lets you send digital packets to control
devices in your home. For example this includes infrared data or 433MHz RF signals.

First, you need to setup a global hub that specifies which pin your remote
sender is connected to. Then you can use the available actions to send encoded
remote signals.

**See** :ref:`remote-setting-up-infrared` **and** :ref:`remote-setting-up-rf` **for set up guides.**

.. note::

    This component is more accurate on the ESP32, since that chipset has a dedicated
    peripheral for sending exact signal sequences.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIOXX
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

Configuration variables:
------------------------

-  **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin to transmit the remote signal on.
-  **carrier_duty_percent** (*Optional*, int): How much of the time the remote is on. For example, infrared
   protocols modulate the signal using a carrier signal. Set this to ``50%`` if you're working with IR LEDs and to
   ``100%`` if working with other things like 433MHz transmitters.
- **rmt_channel** (*Optional*, int): The RMT channel to use. Only on **esp32**.
  The following ESP32 variants have these channels available:

  .. csv-table::
      :header: "ESP32 Variant", "Channels"

      "ESP32", "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7"
      "ESP32-S2", "0, 1, 2, 3"
      "ESP32-S3", "0, 1, 2, 3"
      "ESP32-C3", "0, 1"

-  **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify
   the ID used for code generation. Use this if you have multiple remote transmitters.

.. _remote_transmitter-transmit_action:

Remote Transmitter Actions
--------------------------

Remote transmitters support a number of :ref:`actions <config-action>` that can be used
to send remote codes. All supported protocols are listed below. All actions additionally
have these configuration variables:

.. code-block::yaml

    on_...:
      - remote_transmitter.transmit_x:
          # ...
          repeat:
            times: 5
            wait_time: 10ms

Configuration variables:

- **repeat** (*Optional*): Optionally set the code to be repeated a number of times.
  Defaults to sending the code only once.

  - **times** (:ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, int): The number of times to repeat the code.
  - **wait_time** (:ref:`templatable <config-templatable>`, :ref:`config-time`): The time to wait between repeats (in Âµs as a result of a :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>`).

- **transmitter_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The remote transmitter to send the
  remote code with. Defaults to the first one defined in the configuration.

If you're looking for the same functionality as is default in the ``rpi_rf`` integration in
Home Assistant, you'll want to set the **times** to 10 and the **wait_time** to 0s.

.. _remote_transmitter-transmit_abbwelcome:

``remote_transmitter.transmit_abbwelcome`` **Action**

This :ref:`action <config-action>` sends a ABB-Welcome message to the intercom bus. The
message type, addresses, address length and data can vary a lot between ABB-Welcome
systems. Please refer to the received messages while performing actions like ringing a
doorbell or opening a door.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - remote_transmitter.transmit_abbwelcome:
          source_address: 0x1001 # your indoor station address
          destination_address: 0x4001 # door address
          three_byte_address: false # address length of your system
          message_type: 0x0d # unlock door, on some systems 0x0e is used instead
          data: [0xab, 0xcd, 0xef]  # message data, see receiver dump

Configuration variables:

- **source_address** (**Required**, int):The source address to send the command from,
  see received messages for more info. For indoor stations the last byte of the address
  represents the apartment number set by the dials on the back of the indoor station and is
  transmitted in hexadecimal format.
- **destination_address** (**Required**, int): The destination address to send the command to,
  see received messages for more info.
- **three_byte_address** (**Required**, int): The destination address to send the command to,
  see received messages for more info.
- **three_byte_address** (**Optional**, boolean): The length of the source and destination address. ``false``
  means two bytes and ``true`` means three bytes. Please check the received messages to see which address length
  is used by your system. For example, ``[XXXX > XXXX]`` appears in the receiver log for two byte addresses and
  ``[XXXXXX > XXXXXX]`` for three byte addresses. Defaults to ``false``.
- **retransmission** (**Optional**, boolean): Should only be ``true`` if this message has been transmitted
  before with the same ``message_id``. Typically, messages are transmitted up to three times with a 1 second
  interval if no reply is received. Defaults to ``false``.
- **message_type** (**Required**, int): The message type, see dumper output for more info.
  The highest bit indicates a reply.
- **message_id** (**Optional**, int): The message ID, see dumper output for more info.
  Defaults to a randomly generated ID if this message is not a reply or retransmission.
- **data** (**Optional**, 0-7 bytes list): The code to send.
  Usually you only need to copy this directly from the dumper output. Defaults to ``[]``
- All other options from :ref:`remote_transmitter-transmit_action`.

.. note::

    ABB-Welcome messages are sent over the two-wire bus of your intercom system.
    A custom receiver and transmitter circuit is required.

``remote_transmitter.transmit_nec`` **Action**

This :ref:`action <config-action>` sends an NEC infrared remote code to a remote transmitter.

.. note::

    In version 2021.12, the order of transferring bits was corrected from MSB to LSB in accordance with the NEC standard.
    Therefore, if the configuration file has come from an earlier version of ESPhome, it is necessary to reverse the order of the address and command bits when moving to 2021.12 or above.
    For example, address: 0x84ED, command: 0x13EC becomes 0xB721 and 0x37C8 respectively.
    Additionally, ESPHome does not automatically generate parity bits or pad values to 2 bytes.
    So, in order to send command 0x0, you need to use 0xFF00 (0x00 being the command and 0xFF being the logical inverse).

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      - remote_transmitter.transmit_nec:

RC Switch Protocol
******************

All RC Switch ``protocol`` settings have these settings:

- Either the value is an integer, then the inbuilt protocol definition with the given number
  is used.
- Or a key-value mapping is given, then there are these settings:

  - **pulse_length** (**Required**, int): The pulse length of the protocol - how many microseconds
    one pulse should last for.
  - **sync** (*Optional*): The number of high/low pulses for the sync header, defaults to ``[1, 31]``
  - **zero** (*Optional*): The number of high/low pulses for a zero bit, defaults to ``[1, 3]``
  - **one** (*Optional*): The number of high/low pulses for a one bit, defaults to ``[3, 1]``
  - **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): If this protocol is inverted. Defaults to ``false``.

Lambda calls
************

Actions may also be called from :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`. The ``.transmit()`` call can be populated with
encoded data for a specific protocol by following the example below.
See the full API Reference for more info.

- ``.transmit()``: Transmit an IR code using the remote transmitter.

  .. code-block:: cpp

      // Example - transmit using the Pioneer protocol
      auto call = id(my_transmitter).transmit();
      esphome::remote_base::PioneerData data = { rc_code_1, rc_code_2 };
      esphome::remote_base::PioneerProtocol().encode(call.get_data(), data);
      call.set_send_times(2);
      call.perform();
