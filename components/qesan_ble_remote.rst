The ``qesan_ble_remote`` component allows you to receive button presses from BLE remotes that are often used
for tuya lamps.

This component requires the ``esp32_ble_tracker`` component. This configuration is more reliable than the
default for receiving button presses:

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:
      scan_parameters:
        interval: 100ms
        window: 20ms
        active: false

To find the address and button codes of your remote, configure the component without specifying any address.
When pressing buttons on the remote the codes will appear in the ESPHome log.
