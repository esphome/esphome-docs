    # Example configuration entry
    esp8266:
      board: nodemcuv2
      framework:
        version: recommended

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **board** (**Required**, string): The PlatformIO board ID that should
  be used. Choose the appropriate board from
  `this list <https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif8266/boards>`__ (the icon next to the 
  name can be used to copy the board ID). *This only affects pin aliases, flash size and some internal settings*, if unsure
  choose a generic board from Espressif such as ``esp01_1m``.
- **framework** (*Optional*): Options for the underlying framework used by ESPHome.

  - **version** (*Optional*, string): The base framework version number to use, from
    `esp8266 arduino releases <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases>`__. Defaults to ``recommended``. Additional values

    - ``dev``: Use the latest commit from https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino, note this may break at any time
    - ``latest``: Use the latest *release* from https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases, even if it hasn't been recommended yet.
    - ``recommended``: Use the recommended framework version.

  - **source** (*Optional*, string): The PlatformIO package or repository to use for the framework. This can be used to use a custom or patched version of the framework.
  - **platform_version** (*Optional*, string): The version of the `platformio/espressif8266 <https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif8266/releases/>`__ package to use.

- **restore_from_flash** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to store some persistent preferences in flash memory. Defaults to ``false``.
- **board_flash_mode** (*Optional*, string): The SPI mode of the flash chip. One of ``qio``, ``qout``, ``dio`` and ``dout``. Defaults to ``dout`` for compatibility with all chips. Note: on the next OTA update the actual flash mode is automatically detected and changed to the appropriate one.
- **early_pin_init** (*Optional*, boolean): Specifies whether PINs should be initialised as early as possible to known values. Recommended value is ``false`` where switches are involved, as these will toggle when updating the firmware or when restarting the device. Defaults to ``true``.
