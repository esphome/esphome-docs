    :description: Instructions for setting up a BedJet climate device.
    :image: bedjet.png

The ``bedjet`` component allows you to communicate with a BedJet V3 Climate Comfort
Sleep System.

This component supports the following functionality:

- Set the operating mode: off, heat, cool, turbo (boost)
- Set the desired target temperature
- Set the desired fan speed
- Start one of the saved memory presets, including "Biorhythm" programs
- Show the current status of the BedJet

This component uses the BLE peripheral on an ESP32, so you also need to enable
this component. Please see the :doc:`/components/ble_client` docs for how to discover the MAC
address of your BedJet device.

Component/Hub
-------------

This component is a global hub that maintains the connection to the BedJet device
and delegates status updates to individual platform components.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

    ble_client:
      - mac_address: C4:4F:33:00:00:01
        id: bedjet_ble_id1

    bedjet:
      - id: bedjet_1
        ble_client_id: bedjet_ble_id1

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **ble_client_id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the BLE Client.
- **time_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of a :doc:`/components/time/index` which
  can be used to set the time on the BedJet device.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to dispatch status
  changes to child components. Defaults to ``5s``. Each child component can decide whether to
  publish its own updated state on this interval, or use another (longer) update interval to
  throttle its own updates.

lambda calls
************

From :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can call methods to do some advanced stuff.

- ``.upgrade_firmware``: Check for and install updated BedJet firmware.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      button:
        - platform: template
          name: "Check Bedjet(1) Firmware"
          on_press:
            then:
            - lambda: |-
                id(bedjet_1).upgrade_firmware();

- ``.send_local_time``: If `time_id` is set, attempt to sync the clock now.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      button:
        - platform: template
          name: "Sync Clock"
          on_press:
            then:
            - lambda: |-
                id(my_bedjet_fan).send_local_time();

- ``.set_clock``: Set the BedJet clock to a specified time; works with or without a `time_id`.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      button:
        - platform: template
          name: "Set Clock to 10:10pm"
          on_press:
            then:
            - lambda: |-
                id(my_bedjet_fan).set_clock(22, 10);


``bedjet`` Climate
------------------

The ``climate`` platform exposes the BedJet's climate-related functionality, including
setting the mode and target temperature.

.. code-block:: yaml

    climate:
      - platform: bedjet
        id: my_bedjet_climate_entity
        name: "My BedJet"
        bedjet_id: bedjet_1

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the climate device.
- **bedjet_id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the Bedjet component.
- **heat_mode** (*Optional*, string): The primary heating mode to use for ``HVACMode.HEAT``:

    - ``heat`` (Default) - Setting ``hvac_mode=heat`` uses the BedJet "HEAT" mode.
    - ``extended`` - Setting ``hvac_mode=heat`` uses BedJet "EXT HEAT" mode.

    Whichever is not selected will be made available as a custom preset.

- All other options from :ref:`Climate <config-climate>`.

``bedjet`` Fan
--------------

The ``fan`` platform exposes the BedJet's fan-related functionality, including
on/off and speed control.

When the BedJet is already on, turning the Fan component off will set the BedJet unit's mode to
``OFF``. If it was not already on, it will be turned on to mode ``FAN_ONLY``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fan:
      - platform: bedjet
        id: my_bedjet_fan_entity
        name: "My BedJet Fan"
        bedjet_id: bedjet_1

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the fan device.
- **bedjet_id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the Bedjet component.
- Other options from :ref:`Fan <config-fan>`.

Known issues:
-------------

.. warning::

    BedJet V2 and other devices are not currently supported. Only BedJet V3 is supported.

.. note::

    Only one client can be connected to the BedJet BLE service at a time, so you cannot
    use the BedJet mobile app to monitor or control the BedJet device while this component
    is connected. To use the mobile app, you should disconnect the ESP client first.

    To set up a (dis-)connect switch, see :doc:`/components/switch/ble_client`.

.. note::

    When more than one device is configured and connected, the ESP device may become
    overwhelmed and lead to timeouts while trying to install an updated version of the
    configuration. If this occurs, see the previous note about adding disconnect switches,
    and toggle those off while performing the installation. This will free up resources
    on the ESP and allow the installation to complete.

    Additionally, you may use an :ref:`ota.on_begin <ota-on_begin>` :ref:`Automation<automation>`
    to do this automatically:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        ota:
          on_begin:
            then:
              - logger.log: "Disconnecting clients for OTA update..."
              - switch.turn_off: bedjet_1_monitor
              - switch.turn_off: bedjet_2_monitor
