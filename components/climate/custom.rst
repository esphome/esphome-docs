.. warning::

    :ref:`Custom Components are deprecated<a_note_about_custom_components>`, not recommended for new configurations and
    will be removed from ESPHome in a future release. Please look at creating a real ESPHome component and "importing"
    it into your configuration with :doc:`/components/external_components`.

    You can find some basic documentation on creating your own components at :ref:`contributing_to_esphome`.

.. warning::

    While we try to keep the ESPHome YAML configuration options as stable as possible, the ESPHome API is less
    stable. If something in the APIs needs to be changed in order for something else to work, we will do so.

This component can be used to create custom climate devices in ESPHome using the C++ (Arduino) API.

Please first read :doc:`/components/sensor/custom` guide, the same principles apply here.

The example below is an example of a custom climate device - all climate devices must override
two methods (:apiclass:`Climate <climate::Climate>`):

- ``traits``: This should return a :apiclass:`ClimateTraits <climate::ClimateTraits>` object
  representing the capabilities of the climate device.
- ``control``: This receives a :apiclass:`ClimateCall <climate::ClimateCall>` object that contains
  the command the user tried to set.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "esphome.h"

    class MyCustomClimate : public Component, public Climate {
     public:
      void setup() override {
        // This will be called by App.setup()
      }
      void control(const ClimateCall &call) override {
        if (call.get_mode().has_value()) {
          // User requested mode change
          ClimateMode mode = *call.get_mode();
          // Send mode to hardware
          // ...

          // Publish updated state
          this->mode = mode;
          this->publish_state();
        }
        if (call.get_target_temperature().has_value()) {
          // User requested target temperature change
          float temp = *call.get_target_temperature();
          // Send target temp to climate
          // ...
        }
      }
      ClimateTraits traits() override {
        // The capabilities of the climate device
        auto traits = climate::ClimateTraits();
        traits.set_supports_current_temperature(true);
        traits.set_supported_modes({climate::CLIMATE_MODE_HEAT_COOL});
        return traits;
      }
    };

(Store this file in your configuration directory, for example ``my_climate.h``)

And in YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphome:
      includes:
        - my_climate.h

    climate:
    - platform: custom
      lambda: |-
        auto my_custom_climate = new MyCustomClimate();
        App.register_component(my_custom_climate);
        return {my_custom_climate};

      climates:
        - name: "My Custom Climate"

Configuration variables:

- **lambda** (**Required**, :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>`): The lambda to run for instantiating the
  climate(s).
- **climates** (**Required**, list): A list of climates to initialize. The length here
  must equal the number of items in the ``return`` statement of the ``lambda``.

  - All options from :ref:`Climate <config-climate>`.

See :apiclass:`Climate <climate::Climate>`
