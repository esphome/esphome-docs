    :description: Instructions for setting up PCA9554, PCA9554A, PCA9536 digital port expanders in ESPHome.

The PCA9554 component allows you to use **PCA9554**, **PCA9554A** or **PCA9536** I/O expanders
(`PCA9554 datasheet <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pca9554.pdf>`__, 
`PCA9554A datasheet <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pca9554a.pdf>`__, 
`PCA9536 datasheet <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pca9536.pdf>`__) in ESPHome. 
It uses :ref:`I²C Bus <i2c>` for communication.

    PCA9554A I/O Expander chip

Once configured, you can use any of the **8** pins (PCA9554, PCA9554A) or **4** pins (PCA9536) as
pins for your projects. Within ESPHome they emulate a real internal GPIO pin
and can therefore be used with many of ESPHome's components such as the GPIO
binary sensor or GPIO switch.

.. note::

    The 7 bit I²C device address ranges are:

    - PCA9554: ``0x20`` to ``0x27``
    - PCA9554A: ``0x38`` to ``0x3F``
    - PCA9536: ``0x41``

    For the PCA9554 and PCA9554A, the actual choice of the I²C device address depends on state of the 3 address pins.
    Please refer to the individual datasheets for further details to choose the address.

    Up to eight PCA9554 and an additional eight PCA9554A devices can reside on the same I²C bus. 
    Please note that only one PCA9536 device is allowed per I²C bus due to its fixed address.

    The PCA9554 and PCA9554A provide 8 bits of GPIO's (pin numbers 0-7).
    
    The PCA9536 provides 4 bits of GPIO's (pin numbers 0-3).

    Any option accepting a :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>` can theoretically be used, but some more
    complicated components that do communication through this I/O expander will not work.

    # Example configuration entry
    pca9554:
      - id: 'pca9554a_device'
        address: 0x38
      
    # Individual outputs
    switch:
      - platform: gpio
        name: "PCF9554A Pin #0"
        pin:
          pca9554: pcf9554a_device
          # Use pin number 0
          number: 0

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this ``pca9554`` component.
- **address** (*Optional*, int): The I²C address of the driver.
  Defaults to ``0x20``.



Pin configuration variables:
****************************

- **pca9554** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the ``pca9554`` component of the pin.
- **number** (**Required**, int): The pin number.
- **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): If all read and written values
  should be treated as inverted. Defaults to ``false``.
- **mode** (*Optional*, string): A pin mode to set for the pin at. One of ``INPUT`` or ``OUTPUT``.
