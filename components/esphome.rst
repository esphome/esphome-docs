ESPHome Core Configuration
==========================

.. seo::
    :description: Instructions for setting up the core ESPHome configuration.
    :image: cloud-circle.svg

Here you specify some core information that ESPHome needs to create
firmwares. Most importantly, this is the section of the configuration
where you specify the **name** of the node.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphome:
        name: livingroom
        comment: Living room ESP32 controller
        area: Living Room

    esp32:
        board: nodemcu-32s

.. _esphome-configuration_variables:

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): This is the name of the node. It
  should always be unique in your ESPHome network. May only contain lowercase
  characters, digits and hyphens, and can be at most 24 characters long by default, or 31
  characters long if ``name_add_mac_suffix`` is ``false``.
  See :ref:`esphome-changing_node_name`.
- **friendly_name** (*Optional*, string): This is the name sent to the frontend. It is used
  by Home Assistant as the integration name, device name, and is automatically prefixed to entities
  where necessary.
- **area** (*Optional*, string): This is the area sent to the frontend. It is used
  by Home Assistant as the area / zone which the node belongs to.

Advanced options:

- **build_path** (*Optional*, string): Customize where ESPHome will store the build files
  for your node. By default, ESPHome puts the PlatformIO project it uses to build the
  firmware in the ``.esphome/build/<NODE>`` (or into path from ``ESPHOME_BUILD_PATH`` environment variable if specified) directory,
  but you can customize this behavior using this option. Official docker image automatically use `/build` folder
  as default one in case it is mounted to it.
- **platformio_options** (*Optional*, mapping): Additional options to pass over to PlatformIO in the
  platformio.ini file. See :ref:`esphome-platformio_options`.
- **includes** (*Optional*, list of files): A list of C/C++ files to include in the main (auto-generated) sketch file
  for custom components. The paths in this list are relative to the directory where the YAML configuration file
  is in. See :ref:`esphome-includes`.
- **libraries** (*Optional*, list of libraries): A list of libraries to include in the project. See
  :ref:`esphome-libraries`.
- **comment** (*Optional*, string): Additional text information about this node. Only for display in UI.
- **name_add_mac_suffix** (*Optional*, boolean): Appends the last 3 bytes of the mac address of the device to
  the name in the form ``<name>-aabbcc``. Defaults to ``false``.
  See :ref:`esphome-mac_suffix`.
- **project** (*Optional*): ESPHome Creator's Project information. See :ref:`esphome-creators_project`.

  - **name** (**Required**, string): Name of the project
  - **version** (**Required**, string): Version of the project
  - **on_update** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform when the device firmware is updated.
    This compares the above ``version`` field with the ``version`` that was in the previous firmware
    as long as the ``name`` matches.
    The ``version`` is stored in flash memory when the firmware is first run for future comparisons.
- **min_version** (*Optional*, string): The minimum ESPHome version required to compile this configuration.
  See :ref:`esphome-min_version`.
- **compile_process_limit** (*Optional*, int): The maximum number of simultaneous compile processes to run.
  Defaults to the number of cores of the CPU which is also the maximum you can set.

Old-style platform options, which have been moved to the platform-specific :doc:`esp32 </components/esp32>` and
:doc:`esp8266 </components/esp8266>` sections but are still accepted here for compatibility reasons (usage not
recommended for new projects):

- **platform** (**Required**, string): The platform used, either ``esp8266`` or ``esp32``.
- **board** (**Required**, string): The board used, see
  :doc:`esp32 </components/esp32>` and :doc:`esp8266 </components/esp8266>` for more information.
- **arduino_version** (*Optional*, string): The version of the Arduino framework to compile the project against.
- **esp8266_restore_from_flash** (*Optional*, boolean): For ESP8266s, whether to store some persistent preferences in flash
  memory.

Automations:

- **on_boot** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the node starts. See :ref:`esphome-on_boot`.
- **on_shutdown** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  right before the node shuts down. See :ref:`esphome-on_shutdown`.
- **on_loop** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  on each ``loop()`` iteration. See :ref:`esphome-on_loop`.

.. _esphome-on_boot:

``on_boot``
-----------

This automation will be triggered when the ESP boots up. By default, it is executed after everything else
is already set up. You can however change this using the ``priority`` parameter.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      # ...
      on_boot:
        priority: 600
        # ...
        then:
          - switch.turn_off: switch_1

Configuration variables:

- **priority** (*Optional*, float): The priority to execute your custom initialization code. A higher value
  means a high priority and thus also your code being executed earlier. Please note this is an ESPHome-internal
  value and any change will not be marked as a breaking change. Defaults to ``600``. Priorities (you can use any value between them too):

  - ``800.0``: This is where all hardware initialization of vital components is executed. For example setting switches
    to their initial state.
  - ``600.0``: This is where most sensors are set up.
  - ``250.0``: At this priority, WiFi is initialized.
  - ``200.0``: Network connections like MQTT/native API are set up at this priority.
  - ``-100.0``: At this priority, pretty much everything should already be initialized.

- See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _esphome-on_shutdown:

``on_shutdown``
---------------

This automation will be triggered when the ESP is about to shut down. Shutting down is usually caused by
too many WiFi/MQTT connection attempts, Over-The-Air updates being applied or through the :doc:`deep_sleep`.

.. note::

    It's not guaranteed that all components are in a connected state when this automation is triggered. For
    example, the MQTT client may have already disconnected. For use-cases that require specific shutdown ordering, look at the ``priority`` parameter.

.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      # ...
      on_shutdown:
        priority: 700
        then:
          - switch.turn_off: switch_1

Configuration variables:

- **priority** (*Optional*, float): The priority to execute your custom shutdown code. A higher value
  means a high priority and in case of shutdown triggers that the code is executed **later**.
  Priority is used primarily for the initialization order of components. Shutdowns for these components are handled in *reverse* order, such that e.g. sensors (600) are shutdown before the hardware components (800) they depend on.
  Please note this is an ESPHome-internal value and any change will not be marked as a breaking change.
  Defaults to ``600``. For priority values refer to the list in the :ref:`esphome-on_boot` section.

- See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _esphome-on_loop:

``on_loop``
-----------

This automation will be triggered on every ``loop()`` iteration (usually around every 16 milliseconds).

.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      # ...
      on_loop:
        then:
          # do something

.. _esphome-platformio_options:

``platformio_options``
----------------------

PlatformIO supports a number of options in its ``platformio.ini`` file. With the ``platformio_options``
parameter you can tell ESPHome what options to pass into the ``env`` section of the PlatformIO file
(note you can also do this by editing the ``platformio.ini`` file manually).

You can view a full list of PlatformIO options here: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env.html

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphome:
      # ...
      platformio_options:
        upload_speed: 115200
        board_build.f_flash: 80000000L

.. _esphome-includes:

``includes``
------------

With ``includes`` you can include source files in the generated PlatformIO project.
All files declared with this option are copied to the project each time it is compiled.

You can always look at the generated PlatformIO project (``.esphome/build/<NODE>``) to see what
is happening - and if you want you can even copy the include files directly into the ``src/`` folder.
The ``includes`` option is only a helper option that does that for you.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphome:
      # ...
      includes:
        - my_switch.h

This option behaves differently depending on what the included file is pointing at:

 - If the include string is pointing at a directory, the entire directory tree is copied into the
   src/ folder.
 - If the include string points to a header file (.h, .hpp, .tcc), it is copied in the src/ folder
   AND included in the ``main.cpp`` file. This way the lambda code can access it.
 - If the include string points to a regular source file (.c, .cpp), it is copied in the src/ folder
   AND compiled into the binary. This way implementation of classes and functions in header files can
   be provided.

.. _esphome-libraries:

``libraries``
-------------

With the ``libraries`` option it is possible to include libraries in the PlatformIO project. These libraries will then
be compiled into the resulting firmware, and can be used in code from :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>` and from
custom components.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esphome:
      # ...
      libraries:
        # a library from PlatformIO
        - espressif/esp32-camera

        # a library bundled with Arduino
        - Wire

        # use the git version of a library used by a component
        - esphome/Improv=https://github.com/improv-wifi/sdk-cpp.git#v1.0.0

The most common usage of this option is to include third-party libraries that are available in the `PlatformIO registry
<https://platformio.org/lib>`__. They can be added by listing their name under this option. It is also possible to use
specific versions, or to fetch libraries from a file or git repository. ESPHome accepts the same syntax as the
`pio lib install <https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/userguide/lib/cmd_install.html>`__ command.

Using ``<name>=<source>`` syntax, it is possible to override the version used for libraries that are automatically added
by one of ESPHome's components. This can be useful during development to make ESPHome use a custom fork of a library.

By default, ESPHome does not include any libraries into the project. This means that libraries that are bundled with
Arduino, such as ``Wire`` or ``EEPROM``, aren't available. If you need to use them, you should list them manually under
this option. If they are used by another library, they should be listed before the library that uses them.

.. _preferences-flash_write_interval:

Adjusting flash writes
------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    preferences:
      flash_write_interval: 1min

- **flash_write_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): Customize the frequency in which data is
  flushed to the flash. This setting helps to prevent rapid changes to a component from being quickly
  written to the flash and wearing it out. Defaults to ``1min``.

As all devices have a limited number of flash write cycles, this setting helps to reduce the number of flash writes
due to quickly changing components. In the past, when components such as ``light``, ``switch``, ``fan`` and ``globals``
were changed, the state was immediately committed to flash. The result of this was that the last state of these
components would always restore to its last state on power loss, however, this has the cost of potentially quickly
damaging the flash if these components are quickly changed.

A safety feature has thus been implemented to mitigate issues resulting from the limited number of flash write cycles,
the state is first stored in memory before being flushed to flash after the ``flash_write_interval`` has passed. This
results in fewer flash writes, preserving the flash health.

This behavior can be disabled by setting ``flash_write_interval`` to ``0s`` to immediately commit the state to flash,
however, be aware that this may lead to increased flash wearing and a shortened device lifespan!

For :doc:`ESP8266 </components/esp8266>`, ``restore_from_flash`` must also be set to ``true`` for states to be written to flash.

.. _esphome-changing_node_name:

Changing ESPHome Node Name
--------------------------

Trying to change the name of a node or its address in the network?
You can do so with the ``use_address`` option of the :doc:`WiFi configuration <wifi>`.

Change the device name or address in your YAML to the new value and additionally
set ``use_address`` to point to the old address like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Step 1. Changing name from test8266 to kitchen
    esphome:
      name: kitchen
      # ...

    wifi:
      # ...
      use_address: test8266.local

Now upload the updated config to the device. As a second step, you now need to remove the
``use_address`` option from your configuration again so that subsequent uploads will work again
(otherwise it will try to upload to the old address).

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Step 2
    esphome:
      name: kitchen
      # ...

    wifi:
      # ...
      # Remove or comment out use_address
      # use_address: test8266.local

The same procedure can be done for changing the static IP of a device.


.. _esphome-mac_suffix:

Adding the MAC address as a suffix to the device name
-----------------------------------------------------

Using ``name_add_mac_suffix`` allows :doc:`creators </guides/creators>` to
provision multiple devices at the factory with a single firmware and still
have unique identification for customer installs.

.. note::

    End users will need to create an individual YAML config file if they want to OTA update the
    devices in the future.  Creators can facilitate this process by providing ``dashboard_import`` URL
    for end users.  This allows them to easily update their devices as new features are made available
    upstream.


.. _esphome-creators_project:

Project information
-------------------

This allows creators to add the project name and version to the compiled code. It is currently only
exposed via the logger, mDNS and the device_info response via the native API. The format of the name
should be ``author_name.project_name``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration
    esphome:
      ...
      project:
        name: "jesse.leds_party"
        version: "1.0.0"

.. _esphome-min_version:

Minimum ESPHome version
-----------------------

This allows YAML files to specify the minimum version of ESPHome required to compile.
This is useful in the case of packages where a published package might use features only
available in a newer version of ESPHome. This allows for a more friendly error message.
