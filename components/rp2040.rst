    :description: Configuration for the RP2040 platform for ESPHome.
    :image: rp2040.svg

This component contains platform-specific options for the RP2040 platform.

.. note::

    Support for all aspects of ESPHome on the RP2040 is still in development.

    Only the original model of Raspberry Pi Pico W board is supported, which has the Cypress **CYW43455** chip providing wireless connectivity. It can be identified by a metallic shield encapsulating the radio circuitry. Pico W boards with radio module chips like ESP8285 or similar (labelled as ``RP2040 Pico W-2023`` etc.), are not supported.

    Please search for or create an `issue <https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml>`__ if you encounter an unknown problem.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    rp2040:
      board: rpipicow

.. note::

    As of ESPHome 2024.9.2, the below ``platform_version`` is no longer required as ESPHome internally.
    Using the ``platform_version`` as is below is also known to cause compilation issues due to version mismatching.

    It is recommended to remove the ``platform_version`` from the configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml
