This component contains platform-specific options for the RP2040 platform.

- **Collapsible section**: To add a collapsible section, use the ``collapse`` directive:

  .. code-block:: rst

      .. collapse:: Details

          Something small enough to escape casual notice.
      
      .. collapse:: Open

          :open:

          This section is open by default.
      
      .. collapse:: A long code block

          .. code-block:: python

              print("Not really")
  
  .. collapse:: Details

      Something small enough to escape casual notice.

  .. collapse:: Open

      :open:

      This section is open by default.

  .. collapse:: A long code block

      .. code-block::

          print("Not really")
  
  .. note::

      Note that a blank line is *required* after every ``collapse`` directive.

.. class:: details

A summary
  with details only visible after user interaction.

.. class:: details open


Another summary
  with open details because the source list has the additional class
  value "open".

.. note::

    Support for all aspects of ESPHome on the RP2040 is still in development.
    
    Only the original model of Raspberry Pi Pico W board is supported, which has the Cypress **CYW43455** chip providing wireless connectivity. It can be identified by a metallic shield encapsulating the radio circuitry. Pico W boards with radio module chips like ESP8285 or similar (labelled as ``RP2040 Pico W-2023`` etc.), are not supported.

    Please search for or create an `issue <https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml>`__ if you encounter an unknown problem.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    rp2040:
      board: rpipicow

.. note::

    For now, you need the following added to the config or you will get compile errors and board not found:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    rp2040:
      board: rpipicow
      framework:
        platform_version: https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git


Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **board** (*Optional*, string): The board type. Valid option is ``rpipicow``.
