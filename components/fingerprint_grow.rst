Component/Hub
-------------

The reader can be powered by the 3.3V output of an NodeMCU. As the communication with the reader is done using UART (default baud rate is 57600), you need to have an :ref:`UART bus <uart>` in your configuration with the ``rx_pin`` connected to the reader's ``TX`` and the ``tx_pin`` connected to the reader's ``RX``.

If available on your reader model, it's recommended to connect 3.3VT (touch induction power supply) & 3.3V to 3.3V; WAKEUP (finger detection signal) to a free GPIO pin and define it with the ``sensing_pin`` option to allow the polling function to quickly return when there's no finger on the reader.

.. code-block:: yaml

Binary Sensor
-------------

Configuration variables:

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the enrolling binary sensor.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Binary Sensor <config-binary_sensor>`.


Sensor
------

- **fingerprint_count**: The number of enrolled fingerprints stored on the reader.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **last_finger_id**: The last matched enrolled fingerprint as set by :ref:`fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_matched`.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **last_confidence**: The last matched confidence as set by :ref:`fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_matched`.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **status**: The integer representation of the internal status register of the reader.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **capacity**: The fingerprint storage capacity of the reader.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **security_level**: The integer representation of the currently configured security level of the reader. Higher security levels reduce the false acceptance rate (FAR) at the expense of increasing the false rejection rate (FRR). Range is 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

.. _fingerprint_grow-sleep_mode:

Sleep Mode
----------
The sensor idle power consumption is roughly 20mA. If you plan to keep the device running continuously, it is wise to implement the Sleep Mode, which puts the sensor to sleep (power off) a few seconds after the last communication (configurable with ``idle_period_to_sleep``). It can only be implemented along with the Touch Sensing Feature, since it uses the touch feedback to wake up the sensor.
To implement this feature, you will need one more free GPIO pin to toggle the sensor power on and off and two external components: a 10kOhms resistor and a PNP transistor (like a BC327).

This is a wiring example for the R503 and below you can find the respective configuration:

.. figure:: images/fingeprint_grow-sleep_mode_wiring.jpg
    :align: center
    :width: 50.0%

.. code-block:: yaml

    uart:
      rx_pin: GPIOXX
      tx_pin: GPIOXX
      baud_rate: 57600

    fingerprint_grow:
      sensing_pin: GPIOXX
      sensor_power_pin:
          number: GPIOXX
          inverted: true
      idle_period_to_sleep: 5s

.. _fingerprint_grow-set_new_password:

Setting a New Password
----------------------

.. warning::

    Forgetting the password will render your fingerprint reader unusable!

You can set a new password for your fingerprint reader using the ``new_password:`` configuration option. The password is defined as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fingerprint_grow:
      password: 0x275FE3D2      # Existing password, can be omitted if it's the default of 0x00
      new_password: 0x72AB96CD  # New password

The ``new_password:`` configuration option is meant to be compiled, flashed to the ESP device and run once, after which it's removed and the new password is defined in the ``password:`` configuration option to be compiled and flashed again.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fingerprint_grow:
      password: 0x72AB96CD      # Update the existing password with the new one


.. _fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_start:

``on_finger_scan_start`` Trigger
------------------------------------

With this configuration option, you can trigger an automation when a finger is detected touching the sensor. Very useful to indicate to the user via AuraLed that the sensor has detected the finger touch and will perform the scan. This trigger will **only** activate if your fingerprint sensor is configured with the ``sensing_pin`` option.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_finger_scan_start:
      - fingerprint_grow.aura_led_control:
          state: ALWAYS_ON
          color: GREEN
          speed: 0
          count: 0

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_invalid:

``on_finger_scan_invalid`` Trigger
----------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever a scan fails, e.g. when the finger is not placed correctly on the reader. This is different from ``on_finger_scan_unmatched`` which is triggered when an unknown fingerprint is scanned. This option works best with the ``sensing_pin`` option defined.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_finger_scan_invalid:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: "Invalid finger"

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_matched:

``on_finger_scan_matched`` Trigger
----------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever a finger scan is matched to an enrolled fingerprint.
To use the variables, use a :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>` template, the matched slot number and the confidence are available inside that lambda under the variables named ``finger_id`` and ``confidence``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_finger_scan_matched:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: !lambda 'return "Authorized finger " + to_string(finger_id) + ", confidence " + to_string(confidence);'
      # Pushing a tag_scanned event based on finger_id only if confidence is greater than 50
      - if:
          condition:
            lambda: 'return confidence > 50;'
          then:
            - homeassistant.tag_scanned: !lambda |-
                switch (finger_id) {
                  case 0:
                    return "person_a";
                  case 1:
                    return "person_b";
                  ...
                  default:
                    return "person_unknown";
                }

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_unmatched:

``on_finger_scan_unmatched`` Trigger
------------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever an unknown fingerprint is scanned.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_finger_scan_unmatched:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: "Unauthorized finger"

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_finger_scan_misplaced:

``on_finger_scan_misplaced`` Trigger
------------------------------------

With this configuration option, you can create automations for situations when the finger is in contact with the sensor but not fully covering it, enabling you to perform a successful scan.
This trigger will **only** activate if your fingerprint sensor is configured with the ``sensing_pin`` option. It serves as a useful indicator to alert the user when their touch on the sensor is insufficient.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_finger_scan_misplaced:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: "Misplaced finger"

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_enrollment_scan:

``on_enrollment_scan`` Trigger
------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever a finger is scanned during enrollment.
To use the variables, use a :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>` template, the scan number and the slot number to be enrolled into are available inside that lambda under the variables named ``scan_num`` and ``finger_id``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_enrollment_scan:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: !lambda 'return "Enrolling into slot " + to_string(finger_id) + ", scanned " + to_string(scan_num) + " time(s)";'

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_enrollment_done:

``on_enrollment_done`` Trigger
------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever a finger is successfully enrolled.
To use the variables, use a :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>` template, the slot number enrolled into is available inside that lambda under the variable named ``finger_id``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_enrollment_done:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: !lambda 'return "Enrolled into slot " + to_string(finger_id);'

.. _fingerprint_grow-on_enrollment_failed:

``on_enrollment_failed`` Trigger
--------------------------------

With this configuration option you can write complex automations whenever a finger failed to be enrolled.
To use the variables, use a :ref:`lambda <config-lambda>` template, the slot number that failed to be enrolled into is available inside that lambda under the variable named ``finger_id``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_enrollment_failed:
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: !lambda 'return "Failed to enroll into slot " + to_string(finger_id);'
      # Retry enrollment into the same slot
      - delay: 3s
      - text_sensor.template.publish:
          id: fingerprint_state
          state: !lambda 'return "Retrying enrollment into slot " + to_string(finger_id) + " in 3 seconds...";'
      - delay: 3s
      - fingerprint_grow.enroll: !lambda 'return finger_id;'


``fingerprint_grow.enroll`` Action
----------------------------------

Starts the fingerprint enrollment process on the slot number defined.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - fingerprint_grow.enroll:
            finger_id: 0
            num_scans: 2
        # Shorthand
        - fingerprint_grow.enroll: 0
        # Update the template text sensor for visual feedback
        - text_sensor.template.publish:
            id: fingerprint_state
            state: "Place a finger on the reader"
