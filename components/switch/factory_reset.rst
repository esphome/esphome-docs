Factory Reset Switch
====================

    :description: Instructions for setting up switches that can remotely invalidate all ESPHome preferences stored in flash and reboot ESP.
    :image: restart.svg

The ``factory_reset`` switch allows you to remotely invalidate (reset) all ESPHome :ref:`preferences <preferences-flash_write_interval>` stored in flash memory and reboot your node.
After reboot all states, parameters and variables will be reinitialized with their default values. This is useful:

- for devices preflashed with ESPHome to reset behavior back to factory state
- in case of moving a device to a new environment or starting a new use-case (e.g. reset counters or state)
- for privacy concerns when giving away a device

.. note::

    **USE WITH GREAT CAUTION!** All credentials, global variables, counters and saved states stored in non-volatile memory will be lost with no chance of recovering them.
    Even raw reading of flash memory with ``esptool`` will not help, since data is physically erased from flash memory.

    For devices configured using :doc:`captive portal </components/captive_portal>`, this will reset WiFi settings as well, thus making such devices offline.
    You'll need to be in close proximity to your device to configure it again using a built-in WiFi access point and captive portal.
