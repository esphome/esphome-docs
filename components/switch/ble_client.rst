The ``ble_client`` component is a switch platform that is used to enable
and disable a ``ble_client``. This has several uses, such as minimizing
battery usage or for allowing other clients (Eg phone apps) to connect to
the device.

For more information on BLE services and characteristics, see
:doc:`/components/ble_client`.
