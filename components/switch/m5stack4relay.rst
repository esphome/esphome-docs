    :description: Instructions for setting up m5stack4relay Switch.

The ``m5stack4relay`` switch platform supports the 4 channels of the relay unit. 
The relays can be used to switch up to AC-230V or DC-28V. For more information: https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/4relay

    # Example configuration entry
    m5stack4relay:
        id: M5stackrelay_ID1
        # ...

    switch:
      - platform: m5stack4relay
        id: relay_1
        name: relay1
        channel: 1
        m5stack4relay_id: M5stackrelay_ID1

Configuration variables:
------------------------
The control has all other options from the I2C devices.

**Switch**

- **channel** (*Required*, integer): The channel number to switch, options are 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- **m5stack4relay_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the M5Stack 4 relay.
- **interlock** (*Optional*, list): A list of other switches in an interlock group. See
  :ref:`switch-gpio-interlocking`.
- **interlock_wait_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): For interlocking mode, set how long
  to wait after other items in an interlock group have been disabled before re-activating.
  Useful for motors where immediately turning on in the other direction could cause problems.

- All other options from :ref:`Switch <config-switch>`.

This switch supports the same interlocking as the GPIO switch.
