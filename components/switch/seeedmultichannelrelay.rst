    :description: Instructions for setting up seeedmultichannelrelay Switch.
    :image: seeedmultichannelrelay.jpg

The ``seeedmultichannelrelay`` switch platform supports the 8 channels of the relay unit. There are multi relays which are supported.
The relays can be used to switch up to AC-250V or DC-110V. For more information: 

Below are several links to supported relays

    # Example configuration entry
    seeedmultichannelrelay:
        id: SeeedMultiChannelRelay_ID
        address: 0x11 # changes the address of the seeedmultichannelrelay only runs this once
        # ...

    switch:
      - platform: seeedmultichannelrelay
        id: relay_1
        name: relay1
        channel: relay_1
        seeedmultichannelrelay_id: SeeedMultiChannelRelay_ID

Configuration variables:
------------------------
Control:
- **addres** (*Optional*, hex-address): This should only be added to change the i2c address 
  on the EPROM of the relay. Afterwards the address will be permanently changed.

- All other options from I2C devices.

Switch:
- **channel** (*Required*, string): The name of channel to switch, options are relay_1, relay_2, relay_3 or relay_4.
- **seeedmultichannelrelay_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the Seed relay.
- **interlock** (*Optional*, list): A list of other switches in an interlock group. See
  :ref:`switch-gpio-interlocking`.
- **interlock_wait_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): For interlocking mode, set how long
  to wait after other items in an interlock group have been disabled before re-activating.
  Useful for motors where immediately turning on in the other direction could cause problems.

- All other options from :ref:`Switch <config-switch>`.

This switch supports the same interlocking as the GPIO switch.
