LVGL Widgets
============

At the next level of the LVGL object hierarchy are the widgets, which support styling directly. They can have sub-parts, which may be styled separately. Usually styles are inherited, but this depends on widget specifics or functionality. The widget and its parts have states, and different styling can be set for different states.

Widgets can have children, which can be any other widgets. Think of this as a nested structure. The child widgets move with the parent and, if the parent is hidden, its children will also be hidden.

By default, LVGL draws new widgets on top of old widgets, including their children. When widgets have children, property inheritance takes place. Some properties (typically those related to text and opacity) can be inherited from the parent widgets's styles. When the property is inheritable, the parent will be searched for an object which specifies a value for the property. The parents will use their own :ref:`state <lvgl-widgetproperty-state>` to determine the value. For example, if a button is pressed and the text color is defined by the "pressed" state, this "pressed" text color will be used.

Common properties
-----------------

The properties below are common to all widgets.

**Configuration variables:**

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **x** (*Optional*, int16 or percentage): Horizontal position of the widget.
- **y** (*Optional*, int16 or percentage): Vertical position of the widget.

.. note::

    By default, the ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates are measured from the *top left corner* of the parent's content area. :ref:`Important <lvgl-styling>`: content area starts *after the padding* thus if the parent has a non-zero padding value, position will be shifted with that. Percentage values are calculated from the parent's content area size.

    If specifying ``align``, ``x`` and ``y`` can be used as an offset to the calculated position (can also be negative). They are ignored if :ref:`lvgl-layouts` are used on the parent.

- **height** (*Optional*): Height of the widget in pixels or a percentage, or ``SIZE_CONTENT``.
- **width** (*Optional*): Width of the widget in pixels or a percentage, or ``SIZE_CONTENT``.

.. note::

    The size settings support a special value: ``SIZE_CONTENT``. It means the widget's size in the respective direction will be set to the size of its children. Note that only children on the right and bottom sides will be considered and children on the top and left remain cropped. This limitation makes the behavior more predictable. Widgets with ``hidden`` or ``floating`` flags will be ignored by the ``SIZE_CONTENT`` calculation.

    Similarly to CSS, LVGL also supports ``min_width``, ``max_width``, ``min_height`` and ``max_height``. These are limits preventing a widget's size from becoming smaller/larger than these values. They are especially useful if the size is set by percentage or ``SIZE_CONTENT``.

- **min_width**, **max_width**, **min_height**, **max_height** (*Optional*, int16 or percentage): Sets a minimal/maximal width or a minimal/maximal height. Pixel and percentage values can be used. Percentage values are relative to the dimensions of the parent's content area. Defaults to ``0%``.
- **scrollbar_mode** (*Optional*, string): If a child widget is outside its parent content area (the size without padding), the parent can become scrollable (see the ``scrollable`` :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>`). The widget can either be scrolled horizontally or vertically in one stroke. Scroll bars can appear depending on the setting:
    - ``"OFF"``: Never show the scroll bars (use the double quotes!).
    - ``"ON"``: Always show the scroll bars (use the double quotes!).
    - ``"ACTIVE"``: Show scroll bars while a widget is being scrolled.
    - ``"AUTO"``: Show scroll bars when the content is large enough to be scrolled (default).

- **align** (*Optional*, enum): Alignment of the of the widget relative to the parent. A child widget is clipped to its parent boundaries. One of the values *not* starting with ``OUT_`` (see picture below).
- **align_to** (*Optional*, list): Alignment of the of the widget relative to another widget on the same level:
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID of a widget *to* which you want to align.
    - **align** (**Required**, string): Desired alignment (one of the values starting with ``OUT_``).
    - **x** (*Optional*, int16 or percentage): Horizontal offset position. Default ``0``.
    - **y** (*Optional*, int16 or percentage): Vertical offset position. Default ``0``.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_align.png
    :align: center

- **group** (*Optional*, string): The name of the group of widgets which will interact with a  :doc:`/components/sensor/rotary_encoder`. In every group there is always one focused widget which receives the encoder actions. You need to associate an input device with a group. An input device can send key events to only one group but a group can receive data from more than one input device. If no group is specified for a widget or an encoder, an unnamed default group will be assigned, so in most cases where only one encoder is used it will not be necessary to explicitly specify a group.
- **layout** (*Optional*): See :ref:`lvgl-layouts` for details. Defaults to ``NONE``.
- **styles** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of a *style definition* from the main component configuration to override the theme styles.
- **theme** (*Optional*, list): A list of styles to apply to the widget and children. Same configuration option as at the main component.
- **widgets** (*Optional*, list): A list of LVGL widgets to be drawn as children of this widget. Same configuration option as at the main component.

.. _lvgl-widgetproperty-state:

- **state** (*Optional*, dict): Widgets or their (sub)parts can have have states, which support separate styling. These state styles inherit from the theme, but can be locally set or overridden within style definitions. Can be one of:
    - **checked** (*Optional*, boolean): Toggled or checked state.
    - **default** (*Optional*, boolean): Normal, released state.
    - **disabled** (*Optional*, boolean): Disabled state (also usable with :ref:`shorthand <lvgl-automation-shorthands>` actions ``lvgl.widget.enable`` and ``lvgl.widget.disable``).
    - **edited** (*Optional*, boolean): Edit by an encoder.
    - **focus_key** (*Optional*, boolean): Focused via keypad or encoder but *not* via touch screen.
    - **focused** (*Optional*, boolean): Focused via keypad or encoder or clicked via touch screen.
    - **pressed** (*Optional*, boolean): Being pressed.
    - **scrolled** (*Optional*, boolean): Being scrolled.
    - **user_1**, **user_2**, **user_3**, **user_4** (*Optional*, boolean): Custom states.

By default, states are all ``false``, and they are templatable.
To apply styles to the states, you need to specify them one level above, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - button:
        checkable: true
        state:
          checked: true # here you activate the state to be used at boot
        checked:
          bg_color: 0x00FF00 # here you apply styles to be used when in the respective state

The state itself can be can be changed by interacting with the widget, or through :ref:`actions <lvgl-automation-actions>` with ``lvgl.widget.update``.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-cover` for a cookbook example which demonstrates how to use styling and properties to show different states of a Home Assistant entity.

.. _lvgl-widget-flags:

In addition to visual styling, each widget supports some boolean **flags** to influence the behavior:

- **adv_hittest** (*Optional*, boolean): allow performing more accurate hit (click) test. For example, may help by accounting for rounded corners.
- **checkable** (*Optional*, boolean): toggle checked state when the widget is clicked.
- **click_focusable** (*Optional*, boolean): add focused state to the widget when clicked.
- **clickable** (*Optional*, boolean): make the widget clickable by input devices. Defaults to ``true``. If ``false``, it will pass the click to the widgets behind it (clicking through).
- **event_bubble** (*Optional*, boolean): propagate the events to the parent.
- **floating** (*Optional*, boolean): do not scroll the widget when the parent scrolls and ignore layout.
- **gesture_bubble** (*Optional*, boolean): propagate the gestures to the parent.
- **hidden** (*Optional*, boolean): make the widget hidden (like it wasn't there at all), also usable with :ref:`shorthand <lvgl-automation-shorthands>` actions ``lvgl.widget.show`` and ``lvgl.widget.hide``. Hidden objects are ignored in layout calculations. Defaults to ``false``.
- **ignore_layout** (*Optional*, boolean): the widget is simply ignored by the layouts. Its coordinates can be set as usual.
- **layout_1**, **layout_2** (*Optional*, boolean): custom flags, free to use by layouts.
- **overflow_visible** (*Optional*, boolean): do not clip the children's content to the parent's boundary.
- **press_lock** (*Optional*, boolean): keep the widget pressed even if the press slid from the widget.
- **scroll_chain simple** (*Optional*, boolean): packaging for (``scroll_chain_hor | scroll_chain_ver``).
- **scroll_chain_hor** (*Optional*, boolean): allow propagating the horizontal scroll to a parent.
- **scroll_chain_ver** (*Optional*, boolean): allow propagating the vertical scroll to a parent.
- **scroll_elastic** (*Optional*, boolean): allow scrolling inside but with slower speed.
- **scroll_momentum** (*Optional*, boolean): make the widget scroll further when "thrown".
- **scroll_on_focus** (*Optional*, boolean): automatically scroll widget to make it visible when focused.
- **scroll_one** (*Optional*, boolean): allow scrolling only on ``snappable`` children.
- **scroll_with_arrow** (*Optional*, boolean): allow scrolling the focused widget with arrow keys.
- **scrollable** (*Optional*, boolean): the widget can become scrollable. Defaults to ``true`` (also see the ``scrollbar_mode`` property).
- **snappable** (*Optional*, boolean): if scroll snap is enabled on the parent it can snap to this widget.
- **user_1**, **user_2**, **user_3**, **user_4** (*Optional*, boolean): custom flags, free to use by user.
- **widget_1**, **widget_2** (*Optional*, boolean): custom flags, free to use by widget.

.. note::

    LVGL only supports **integers** for numeric ``value``. Visualizer widgets can't display floats directly, but they allow scaling by 10s. Some examples in the :doc:`Cookbook </cookbook/lvgl>` cover how to do that.

.. _lvgl-widget-parts:

Widget parts
------------

Widgets can have multiple parts, each of which can be styled independently. For example, a checkbox has a *main* part that styles the background and text label, and an *indicator* part that styles the tick box. All widgets have a *main* part, the available parts for other widgets are specified in the widget description.

The possible parts are:

- **main** (*Optional*, dict): The main part of the widget, i.e. the background. Any style properties applied at the top level of the widget are assumed to apply to this part, but may also be specified under the *main* config key.
- **scrollbar** (*Optional*, dict): The scrollbar styles.
- **indicator** (*Optional*, dict): The indicator part of the widget. The indicator part may be used to show tick boxes or other visual indicators in slider, bar or arc.
- **knob** (*Optional*, dict): The knob part of the widget e.g. a draggable item in slider, bar or arc.
- **selected** (*Optional*, dict): The currently selected part of the widget, e.g. text or the selected item in a roller.
- **items** (*Optional*, dict): The items part of the widget, e.g. the items in a roller.
- **ticks** (*Optional*, dict): Ticks on scales for a meter.
- **cursor** (*Optional*, dict): The cursor part of the widget, e.g. the cursor in a spinbox.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example slider with knob and indicator styling
    - slider:
        # main (background) styles
        bg_opa: cover
        bg_grad: color_bar
        radius: 0
        indicator:
          bg_opa: transp    # Makes the indicator part invisible
        knob:
          radius: 1
          width: 4
          height: 10%
          bg_color: 0x000000

Widget-specific properties
--------------------------

Some widgets have properties that are specific to that widget. For example ``label`` has a ``text`` property. The properties
specific to a widget are described in each section below. Some of these properties may also be updated with a corresponding
``lvgl.<widget_type>.update`` action, e.g. ``lvgl.label.update`` allows updating not only the common style properties,
but also the ``text`` property of a label.


.. _text-property:

Text property
-------------

Several widgets have a ``text`` property, and the possible ways this can be specified are common to all ``text`` properties.
The text may be a Unicode string or other constant convertible to a string; if the string is enclosed in double quotes ``""`` then
standard escape sequences sucn as newline ``\n`` and Unicode codepoints will be translated.
The text value may also be a lambda returning a ``std::string`` or may be
specified with a ``format`` property utilising ``printf`` style formatting. There is also a ``time_format`` option
which allows use of `strftime <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/>`_ formats.


**Examples:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example label
    - label:
        id: label_id
        text: "Text string"
    - checkbox:
        id: checkbox_id
        text: "\uF00C"  # Unicode check-mark


    on_...:
      - lvgl.label.update:
          id: label_id
          text:
            format: "%d bells, %d things"
            args: [x, 10]  # x is a value from the enclosing trigger.
      - lvgl.label.update:
          id: label_id
          text: !lambda return id(text_sensor).state;
      - lvgl.label.update:
          id: label_id
          text:
            time_format: "%c"   # uses default time component
      - lvgl.checkbox.update:
          id: checkbox_id
          text:
            time_format: "%c"
            time: sntp_id
      - lvgl.label.update:
          id: label_id
          text:
            time_format: "%c"
            time: !lambda return id(sntp_id).utcnow();



.. _lvgl-widget-animimg:

``animimg``
-----------

The animation image is similar to the normal ``image`` widget. The main difference is that instead of one source image, you set a list of multiple source images. You can also specify a duration and a repeat count.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_animimg.gif
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **src** (**Required**, list of :ref:`images <display-image>`): A list of IDs of existing image configurations to be loaded as frames of the animation.
- **auto_start** (*Optional*, boolean): Start the animation playback automatically at boot and when updating the widget. Defaults to ``true``.
- **duration** (**Required**, :ref:`Time <config-time>`): Total duration of a playback cycle (each frame is displayed for an equal amount of time).
- **repeat_count** (*Optional*, int16 or *forever*): The number of times playback should be repeated. Defaults to ``forever``.
- Some style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling` for the background rectangle that uses the typical background style properties and the image itself using the image style properties.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.animimg.start`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` starts the animation playback if it was displayed with ``auto_start`` false or after ``repeat_count`` expired.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of animimg widgets which you want start.

- ``lvgl.animimg.stop`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` stops the animation playback.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of animimg widgets which you want stop.

- ``lvgl.animimg.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` can be used to change ``repeat_count`` and ``duration``, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags. ``src`` and ``auto_start`` cannot be updated at runtime.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of animimg widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - animimg:
        align: CENTER
        id: anim_id
        src: [ cat_image, cat_image_bowtie ]
        duration: 1000ms

    # Example actions:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.animimg.update:
            id: anim_id
            repeat_count: 100
            duration: 300ms

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-animbatt` in the Cookbook for a more detailed example.

.. _lvgl-widget-arc:

``arc``
-------

The arc consists of a background and a foreground arc. The indicator foreground can be touch-adjusted with a knob.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_arc.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **adjustable** (*Optional*, boolean): Add a knob that the user can move to change the value. Defaults to ``false``.
- **arc_color** (*Optional*, :ref:`color <lvgl-color>`): Color used to draw the arc.
- **arc_opa** (*Optional*, :ref:`opacity <lvgl-opacity>`): Opacity of the arc.
- **arc_rounded** (*Optional*, boolean): Make the end points of the arcs rounded. ``true`` rounded, ``false`` perpendicular line ending.
- **arc_width** (*Optional*, int16): Set the width of the arcs in pixels.
- **change_rate** (*Optional*, int8): If the arc is pressed the current value will set with a limited speed according to the set change rate. The change rate is defined in degree/second. Defaults to ``720``.
- **end_angle** (*Optional*, 0-360): end angle of the arc background (see note). Defaults to ``45``.
- **indicator** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the indicator *part* to show the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. Draws *another arc using the arc style* properties. Its padding values are interpreted relative to the background arc.
- **knob** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the knob *part* to control the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. Draws a handle on the end of the indicator using all background properties and padding values. With zero padding the knob size is the same as the indicator's width. Larger padding makes it larger, smaller padding makes it smaller.
- **max_value** (*Optional*, int8): Maximum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``100``.
- **min_value** (*Optional*, int8): Minimum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``0``.
- **mode** (*Optional*, string): ``NORMAL``: the indicator is drawn from the minimum value to the current. ``REVERSE``: the indicator is drawn counter-clockwise from the maximum value to the current. ``SYMMETRICAL``: the indicator is drawn from the middle point to the current value. Defaults to ``NORMAL``.
- **rotation** (*Optional*, 0-360): Offset to the 0 degree position. Defaults to ``0.0``.
- **start_angle** (*Optional*, 0-360): start angle of the arc background (see note). Defaults to ``135``.
- **value** (**Required**, int8): Actual value of the indicator at start, in ``0``-``100`` range. Defaults to ``0``.
- Any :ref:`Styling <lvgl-styling>` and state-based option to override styles inherited from parent. The arc's size and position will respect the padding style properties.

If the ``adv_hittest`` :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>` is enabled the arc can be clicked through in the middle. Clicks are recognized only on the ring of the background arc.

.. note::

    The zero degree position is at the middle right (3 o'clock) of the widget and the degrees increase in a clockwise direction from there. Angles are specified in the ``0``-``360`` range.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.arc.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of arc widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when the knob changes the value of the arc. The new value is returned in the variable ``x``.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - arc:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        id: arc_id
        value: 75
        min_value: 0
        max_value: 100
        adjustable: true

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.arc.update:
            id: arc_id
            knob:
              bg_color: 0x00FF00
            value: 55

    # Example trigger:
    - arc:
        ...
        on_value:
          - logger.log:
              format: "Arc value is: %.0f"
              args: [ 'x' ]

.. note::

    The ``on_value`` trigger is sent as the arc knob is dragged or changed with keys. The event is sent *continuously* while the arc knob is being dragged; this generally has a negative effect on performance. To mitigate this, consider using a :ref:`universal interaction trigger <lvgl-automation-triggers>` like ``on_release``, to get the ``x`` variable once after the interaction has completed.

The ``arc`` can be also integrated as a :doc:`Number </components/number/lvgl>` or :doc:`Sensor </components/sensor/lvgl>` component.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-bright` and :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-volume` for examples which demonstrate how to use a slider (or an arc) to control entities in Home Assistant.

.. _lvgl-widget-bar:

``bar``
-------

The bar widget has a background and an indicator foreground on it. The size of the indicator is set according to the current ``value`` of the bar.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_bar.png
    :align: center

Vertical bars can be created if the width is smaller than the height.

Not only the end, but also the start value of the bar can be set, which changes the start position of the indicator.

**Configuration variables:**

- **anim_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`Time <config-time>`): Sets the animation time if the value is set with ``animated: true``.
- **animated** (*Optional*, boolean): Animate the indicator when the bar changes value. Defaults to ``true``.
- **indicator** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the indicator *part* to show the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize, all the typical background properties.
- **max_value** (*Optional*, int8): Maximum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``100``.
- **min_value** (*Optional*, int8): Minimum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``0``.
- **mode** (*Optional*, string): ``NORMAL``: the indicator is drawn from the minimum value to the current. ``REVERSE``: the indicator is drawn counter-clockwise from the maximum value to the current. ``SYMMETRICAL``: the indicator is drawn from the middle point to the current value. Defaults to ``NORMAL``.
- **value** (**Required**, int8): Actual value of the indicator at start, in ``0``-``100`` range. Defaults to ``0``.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling`. The background of the bar and it uses the typical background style properties. Adding padding will make the indicator smaller or larger.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.bar.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of bar widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - bar:
        x: 10
        y: 100
        id: bar_id
        value: 75
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.bar.update:
            id: bar_id
            value: 55

The ``bar`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Number </components/number/lvgl>` or :doc:`Sensor </components/sensor/lvgl>` component.

.. _lvgl-widget-button:

``button``
----------

Simple push (momentary) or toggle (two-states) button.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_button.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **checkable** (*Optional*, boolean): A significant :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>` to make a toggle button (which remains pressed in ``checked`` state). Defaults to ``false``.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling` for the background of the button. Uses the typical background style properties.

A notable state is ``checked`` (boolean) which can have different styles applied.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated after clicking. If ``checkable`` is ``true``, the boolean variable ``x``, representing the checked state, may be used by lambdas within this trigger.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - button:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        width: 50
        height: 30
        id: btn_id

To have a button with a text label on it, add a child :ref:`lvgl-widget-label` widget to it:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example toggle button with text:
    - button:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        width: 70
        height: 30
        id: btn_id
        checkable: true
        widgets:
          - label:
              align: center
              text: "Light"

    # Example trigger:
    - button:
        ...
        on_value:
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Button checked state: %d"
                args: [ x ]

The ``button`` can be also integrated as a :doc:`Binary Sensor </components/binary_sensor/lvgl>` or as a :doc:`Switch </components/switch/lvgl>` component.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-binent` for an example which demonstrates how to use a checkable button to act on a Home Assistant service.

.. _lvgl-widget-buttonmatrix:

``buttonmatrix``
----------------

The button matrix widget is a lightweight way to display multiple buttons in rows and columns. It's lightweight because the buttons are not actually created but instead simply drawn on the fly. This reduces the memory footprint of each button from approximately 200 bytes (for both the button and its label widget) down to only eight bytes.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_buttonmatrix.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **rows** (**Required**, list): A list for the button rows:

- The :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers can be configured for the main widget, they pass the ID of the pressed button (or null if nothing pressed) as variable ``x`` (a pointer to a ``uint16_t`` which holds the index number of the button).

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - buttonmatrix:
        x: 10
        y: 40

          - buttons:
            ...
            - id: button_2
              ...
              control:
                checkable: true
              on_value: # Trigger for the individual button, returning the checked state
                then:
                  - logger.log:
                      format: "Button 2 checked: %d"
                      args: [ x ]
        on_press: # Triggers for the matrix, to determine which button was pressed.
          logger.log:
            format: "Matrix button pressed: %d"
            args: ["x"]  # If x is 65535, it was the container, (or through a disabled button).
        on_click:
          logger.log:
            format: "Matrix button clicked: %d, is button_2 = %u"
            args: ["x", "id(button_2) == x"]

.. tip::

    The Button Matrix widget supports the :ref:`key_collector` to collect the button presses as key press sequences for further automations. Check out :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-keypad` for an example.

.. _lvgl-widget-checkbox:

``checkbox``
------------

The checkbox widget is made internally from a *tick box* and a label. When the checkbox is clicked the tick box's ``checked`` state will be toggled.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_checkbox.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **indicator** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the indicator *part* to show the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. The "tick box" is a square that uses all the typical background style properties. By default, its size is equal to the height of the main part's font. Padding properties make the tick box larger in the respective directions.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling` for the background of the widget and it uses the text and all the typical background style properties. ``pad_column`` adjusts the spacing between the tick box and the label.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.checkbox.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of checkbox widgets to be updated.
    - **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): Text to display beside the checkbox.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when toggling the checkbox. The boolean variable ``x``, representing the checkbox's state, may be used by lambdas within this trigger.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - checkbox:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        id: checkbox_id
        text: Checkbox

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.checkbox.update:
            id: checkbox_id
            state:
              checked: true
            text: Checked

    # Example trigger:
    - checkbox:
        ...
        on_value:
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Checkbox state: %d"
                args: [ x ]

.. note::

    In case you configure ``default_font`` in the main section to a custom font, the checkmark will not be shown correctly when the checkbox is in the checked state. See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-ckboxmark` for how to easily resolve this.

The ``checkbox`` can be also integrated as a :doc:`Switch </components/switch/lvgl>` component.

.. _lvgl-widget-dropdown:

``dropdown``
------------

The dropdown widget allows the user to select one value from a list.

The dropdown list is closed by default and displays a single value. When activated (by clicking on the drop-down list), a list is drawn from which the user may select one option. When the user selects a new value, the list is deleted from the screen.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_dropdown.png
    :align: center

The Dropdown widget is built internally from a *button* part and a *list* part (both not related to the actual widgets with the same name).

**Configuration variables:**

- **dir** (*Optional*, str): Where the list part of the dropdown gets created relative to the button part. ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``, ``BOTTOM``, ``TOP``, defaults to ``BOTTOM``.
- **dropdown_list** (*Optional*, dict): Settings for the the list with items. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` to customize. Notable are ``text_line_space`` and ``pad_all`` for spacing of list items, and ``text_font`` to separately change the font in the list. The parts ``main``, ``scrollbar`` and ``selected`` may be customised. Note that changing styles on the selected item should be done in the ``selected`` part with ``checked`` state. ``max_height`` can be used to limit the height of the list.
- **indicator** (*Optional*, dict): Styles for the dropdown symbol.
- **options** (**Required**, list): The list of available options in the drop-down.
- **selected_index** (*Optional*, int8): The index of the item you wish to be selected.
- **selected_text** (*Optional*, string): The text of the item you wish to be selected.
- **symbol** (*Optional*, dict): A symbol (typically an chevron) is shown in dropdown list. If ``dir`` of the drop-down list is ``LEFT`` the symbol will be shown on the left, otherwise on the right. Choose a different :ref:`symbol <lvgl-fonts>` from those built-in or from your own customized font.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling` for the background of the button. Uses the typical background properties and :ref:`lvgl-widget-label` text properties for the text on it. ``text_font`` can be used to set the font of the button part, including the symbol.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.dropdown.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of dropdown widgets to update.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above to update.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated only when you select an item from the list. The new selected index is returned in the variable ``x``. The :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers also apply, and they also return the selected index in ``x``.
- ``on_cancel`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is also activated when you close the dropdown without selecting an item from the list. The currently selected index is returned in the variable ``x``.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - dropdown:
        id: dropdown_id
        width: 90
        align: CENTER
        options:
          - Violin
          - Piano
          - Bassoon
          - Chello
          - Drums
        selected_index: 2
        dropdown_list:
          selected:
            checked:
              text_color: 0xFF0000

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.dropdown.update:
            id: dropdown_id
            selected_index: 4

    # Example trigger:
    - dropdown:
        ...
        on_value:
          - logger.log:
              format: "Selected index is: %d"
              args: [ x ]
        on_cancel:
          - logger.log:
              format: "Dropdown closed. Selected index is: %d"
              args: [ x ]

The ``dropdown`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Select </components/select/lvgl>` component.

.. _lvgl-widget-image:

``image``
---------

Images are the basic widgets used to display images.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_image.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **angle** (*Optional*, 0-360): Rotation of the image. Defaults to ``0.0``. Needs ``pivot_x`` and ``pivot_y`` to be specified.
- **antialias** (*Optional*): The quality of the angle or scale transformation. When anti-aliasing is enabled, the transformations are higher quality but slower. Defaults to ``false``.
- **mode** (*Optional*): Either ``REAL`` or  ``VIRTUAL``. With ``VIRTUAL``, when the image is scaled or rotated, the real coordinates of the image object are not changed. The larger content simply overflows the object's boundaries. It also means the layouts are not affected the by the transformations. With ``REAL``, if the width/height of the object is set to ``SIZE_CONTENT``, the object's size will be set to the scaled and rotated size. If an explicit size is set, the overflowing content will be cropped. Defaults to ``VIRTUAL``.
- **offset_x** (*Optional*): Add a horrizontal offset to the image position.
- **offset_y** (*Optional*): Add a vertical offset to the image position.
- **pivot_x** (*Optional*): Horizontal position of the pivot point of rotation, in pixels, relative to the top left corner of the image.
- **pivot_y** (*Optional*): Vertical position of the pivot point of rotation, in pixels, relative to the top left corner of the image.
- **zoom** (*Optional*, 0.1-10): Zoom of the image.
- **src** (**Required**, :ref:`image <display-image>`): The ID of an existing image configuration.
- Some style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling` for the background rectangle that uses the typical background style properties and the image itself using the image style properties.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.image.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags. Updating the ``src`` option changes the image at runtime.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of image widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - image:
        align: CENTER
        src: cat_image
        id: img_id
        radius: 11
        clip_corner: true

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.image.update:
            id: img_id
            src: cat_image_bowtie

.. note::

    Currently ``RGB565`` type images are supported, with transparency using the optional parameter ``use_transparency`` set to ``true``. See :ref:`display-image` for how to load an image for rendering in ESPHome.

.. tip::

    ``offset_x`` and ``offset_y`` can be useful when the widget size is set to be smaller than the image source size. A "running image" effect can be created by animating these values.

.. _lvgl-widget-keyboard:

``keyboard``
------------

The keyboard widget is a special Button matrix with predefined keymaps and other features to show an on-screen keyboard usable to type text into a :ref:`lvgl-widget-textarea`.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_keyboard.png
    :align: center

For styling, the ``keyboard`` widget uses the same settings as :ref:`lvgl-widget-buttonmatrix`.

**Configuration variables:**

- **textarea** (*Optional*): The ID of a ``textarea`` to associate with the keyboard. If provided, all key entries are recorded in the ``textarea``.
- **mode** (*Optional*, enum): Keyboard layout to use. Each ``TEXT_`` layout contains a button to allow the user to iterate through the ``TEXT_`` layouts.
    - ``TEXT_LOWER``: Display lower case letters (default).
    - ``TEXT_UPPER``: Display upper case letters.
    - ``TEXT_SPECIAL``: Display special characters.
    - ``NUMBER``: Display numbers, +/- sign, and decimal dot.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.keyboard.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the properties from the specific options above, plus any from :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>`.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of keyboard widgets which you want to update.
    - Styles or properties to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_ready`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when the checkmark key is pressed.
- ``on_cancel`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when the key containing the keyboard icon is pressed.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - keyboard:
        id: keyboard_id
        textarea: textarea_1
        mode: TEXT_UPPER

    # Example actions:
    on_focus:
      then:
        - lvgl.keyboard.update:
            id: keyboard_id
            mode: number
            textarea: textarea_2

    # Example trigger:
    - keyboard:
        ...
        on_ready:
          then:
            - logger.log: Keyboard is ready
        on_cancel:
          then:
            - logger.log: Keyboard cancelled

.. tip::

    The Keyboard widget supports the :ref:`key_collector` to collect the button presses as key press sequences for further automations.

.. note::

    The Keyboard widget in ESPHome doesn't support popovers or custom layouts.

.. _lvgl-widget-label:

``label``
---------

A label is the basic widget type that is used to display text.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_label.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **long_mode** (*Optional*, list): By default, the width and height of the label is set to ``SIZE_CONTENT``. Therefore, the size of the label is automatically expanded to the text size. Otherwise, if the ``width`` or ``height`` are explicitly set (or set by :ref:`lvgl-layouts`), the lines wider than the label's width can be manipulated according to the long mode policies below. These policies can be applied if the height of the text is greater than the height of the label.
    - ``WRAP``: Wrap lines which are too long. If the height is ``SIZE_CONTENT``, the label's height will be expanded, otherwise the text will be clipped (default).
    - ``DOT``: Replaces the last 3 characters from bottom right corner of the label with dots.
    - ``SCROLL``: If the text is wider than the label, scroll the text horizontally back and forth. If it's higher, scroll vertically. Text will scroll in only one direction; horizontal scrolling has higher precedence.
    - ``SCROLL_CIRCULAR``: If the text is wider than the label, continuously scroll the text horizontally. If it's higher, scroll vertically. Text will scroll in only one direction; horizontal scrolling has higher precedence.
    - ``CLIP``: Simply clip the parts of the text outside the label.
- **recolor** (*Optional*, boolean): Enable recoloring of button text with ``#``. This makes it possible to set the color of characters in the text individually by prefixing the text to be re-colored with a ``#RRGGBB`` hexadecimal color code followed by a *space*, and finally closed with a single hash ``#`` tag. For example: ``Write a #FF0000 red# word``.
- **scrollbar** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the indicator *part* to show the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. The scroll bar that is shown when the text is larger than the widget's size.
- **selected** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the the style of the selected text. Only ``text_color`` and ``bg_color`` style properties can be used.
- **text_align** (*Optional*, enum): Alignment of the text in the widget - it doesn't align the object itself, only the lines inside the object. One of ``LEFT``, ``CENTER``, ``RIGHT``, ``AUTO``. Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``AUTO``, which detects the text base direction and uses left or right alignment accordingly.
- **text_color** (*Optional*, :ref:`color <lvgl-color>`): Color to render the text in. Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``0`` (black).
- **text_decor** (*Optional*, list): Choose decorations for the text: ``NONE``, ``UNDERLINE``, ``STRIKETHROUGH`` (multiple can be specified as YAML list). Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``NONE``.
- **text_font**: (*Optional*, :ref:`font <lvgl-fonts>`):  The ID of the font used to render the text or symbol. Inherited from parent.
- **text_letter_space** (*Optional*, int16): Extra character spacing of the text. Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``0``.
- **text_line_space** (*Optional*, int16): Line spacing of the text. Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``0``.
- **text_opa** (*Optional*, :ref:`opacity <lvgl-opacity>`): Opacity of the text. Inherited from parent. Defaults to ``COVER``.
- **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): Text to display on the label.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling`. Uses all the typical background properties and the text properties. The padding values can be used to add space between the text and the background.

.. note::

    Newline escape sequences are handled automatically by the label widget. You can use ``\n`` to make a line break. For example: ``"line1\nline2\n\nline4"``. For escape sequences like newline to be translated, *enclose the string in double quotes*.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.label.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of label widgets to be updated.
    - **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): Text to display on the button.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - label:
        align: CENTER
        id: lbl_id
        recolor: true
        text: "#FF0000 write# #00FF00 colored# #0000FF text#"

    - label:
        align: TOP_MID
        id: lbl_symbol
        text_font: montserrat_28
        text: "\uF013"

    # Example action (update label with a value from a sensor):
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.label.update:
            id: lbl_id
            text:
              format: "%.0fdBm"
              args: [ 'id(wifi_signal_db).get_state()' ]

The ``label`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Text </components/text/lvgl>` or :doc:`Text Sensor </components/text_sensor/lvgl>` component.

- ``lvgl.led.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of led widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - led:
        id: led_id
        align: CENTER
        color: 0xFF0000
        brightness: 70%

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.led.update:
            id: led_id
            color: 0x00FF00

The ``led`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Light </components/light/lvgl>` component.

.. note::

    If configured as a light component, ``color`` and ``brightness`` are overridden by the light at startup, according to its ``restore_mode`` setting.

Check out :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-keypad` in the Cookbook for an example which demonstrates how to change the ``led`` styling properties from an automation.

.. _lvgl-widget-line:

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-gauge`, :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-thermometer` and :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-clock` in the Cookbook for examples which demonstrate how to effectively use this widget.

.. _lvgl-widget-msgbox:

``msgboxes``
------------

The message boxes act as pop-ups. They are built from a background container, a title, an optional close button, a text and optional buttons.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_msgbox.png
    :align: center

The text will be broken into multiple lines automatically and the height will be set automatically to include the text and the buttons. The message box is modal (blocks clicks on the rest of the screen until closed).

**Configuration variables:**

- **msgboxes** (*Optional*, list): A list of message boxes to use. This option is available only at the top level of the LVGL component configuration. Each list entry may have the following options:
    - **title** (**Required**, string): A string to display at the top of the message box.
    - **body** (*Optional*, dict): The content of the body of the message box:
        - **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): The text to display in the body of the message box.
        - Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling`. Uses all the typical background properties and the text properties.
    - **buttons** (*Optional*, list): A list of buttons to show at the bottom of the message box:
        - **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): Text to display on the button.
        - See :ref:`lvgl-widget-buttonmatrix` for other options for the buttons.
    - **button_style** (*Optional*, dict): A style to apply to the buttons. Uses all the typical style properties. Buttons cannot be individually styled since they are part of a ``buttonmatrix``.
    - **close_button** (*Optional*, boolean): Controls the presence of the close button to the top right of the message box. Defaults to true

**Actions:**

The configured message boxes are hidden by default. They can be shown and hidden using ``lvgl.widget.show`` and ``lvgl.widget.hide`` respectively :ref:`actions <lvgl-automation-shorthands>`.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    lvgl:
      ...
      msgboxes:
        - id: message_box
          close_button: true
          title: Message box
          body:
            text: "This is a sample message box."
            bg_color: 0x808080
          buttons:
            - id: msgbox_apply
              text: "Apply"
            - id: msgbox_close
              text: "\uF00D"
              on_click:
                then:
                  - lvgl.widget.hide: message_box

.. tip::

    You can create your own more complex dialogs with a full-screen sized, half-opaque ``obj`` with any child widgets on it, and the ``hidden`` flag set to ``true`` by default. For non-modal dialogs, simply set the ``clickable`` flag to ``false`` on it.

.. _lvgl-widget-obj:

``obj``
-------

The base object is just a simple, empty widget. By default, it's nothing more than a rounded rectangle:

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_baseobj.png
    :align: center

You can use it as a parent container for other widgets. By default, it catches touches.

**Configuration variables:**

- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling`.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:

      then:
        - lvgl.qrcode.update:
            id: lv_qr
            text: home-assistant.io

.. _lvgl-widget-roller:

``roller``
----------

Roller allows you to simply select one option from a list by scrolling.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_roller.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **anim_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`Time <config-time>`): When the Roller is scrolled and doesn't stop exactly on an option it will scroll to the nearest valid option automatically in this amount of time.
- **mode** (*Optional*, enum): Option to make the roller circular. ``NORMAL`` or ``INFINITE``, defaults to ``NORMAL``.
- **options** (**Required**, list): The list of available options in the roller.
- **selected_index** (*Optional*, int8): The index of the item you wish to be selected.

The selected option in the middle. Besides the typical background properties it uses the :ref:`lvgl-widget-label` text style properties to change the appearance of the text in the selected area.
- **visible_row_count** (*Optional*, int8): The number of visible rows.
- Style options from :ref:`lvgl-styling`. The background of the roller uses all the typical background properties and :ref:`lvgl-widget-label` style properties. ``text_line_space`` adjusts the space between the options.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.roller.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
- **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of roller widgets to be updated.
- **animated** (*Optional*, boolean): Animate the indicator when the bar changes value. Defaults to ``true``.
- All the other roller options as listed above.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when you select an item from the list. The new selected index is returned in the variable ``x``, and the text of the selected item is returned in the variable ``text``.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the selected index in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - roller:
        align: CENTER
        id: roller_id
        options:

        - lvgl.roller.update:
            id: roller_id
            selected_index: 4

    # Example trigger:
    - roller:
        ...
        on_value:
          - logger.log:
              format: "Selected index is: %d, text is: %s"
              args: [x, text.c_str()]

The ``roller`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Select </components/select/lvgl>` component.

.. _lvgl-widget-slider:

``slider``
----------

The slider widget looks like a bar supplemented with a knob. The user can drag the knob to set a value. Just like bar, slider can be vertical or horizontal. The size of the indicator foreground and the knob position is set according to the current ``value`` of the slider.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_slider.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **anim_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`Time <config-time>`): Sets the animation time if the value is set with ``animated: true``.
- **animated** (*Optional*, boolean): Animate the indicator when the bar changes value. Defaults to ``true``.
- **indicator** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the indicator *part* to show the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. The indicator shows the current state of the slider. Also uses all the typical background style properties.
- **knob** (*Optional*, list): Settings for the knob *part* to control the value. Supports a list of :ref:`styles <lvgl-styling>` and state-based styles to customize. A rectangle (or circle) is drawn at the current value. Also uses all the typical background properties to describe the knob. By default, the knob is square (with an optional corner radius) with side length equal to the smaller side of the slider. The knob can be made larger with the padding values. Padding values can be asymmetric.
- **max_value** (*Optional*, int8): Maximum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``100``.
- **min_value** (*Optional*, int8): Minimum value of the indicator. Defaults to ``0``.
- **value** (**Required**, int8): Actual value of the indicator at start, in ``0``-``100`` range. Defaults to ``0``.
- Any :ref:`Styling <lvgl-styling>` and state-based option for the background of the slider. Uses all the typical background style properties. Padding makes the indicator smaller in the respective direction.

Normally, the slider can be adjusted either by dragging the knob, or by clicking on the slider bar. In the latter case the knob moves to the point clicked and slider value changes accordingly. In some cases it is desirable to set the slider to react on dragging the knob only. This feature is enabled by enabling the ``adv_hittest`` flag.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.slider.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of slider widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when the knob changes the value of the slider. The new value is returned in the variable ``x``.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - slider:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        width: 220
        id: slider_id
        value: 75
        min_value: 0
        max_value: 100

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.slider.update:
            id: slider_id
            knob:
              bg_color: 0x00FF00
            value: 55

    # Example trigger:
    - slider:
        ...
        on_value:
          - logger.log:
              format: "Slider value is: %.0f"
              args: [ 'x' ]

.. note::

    The ``on_value`` trigger is sent as the slider is dragged or changed with keys. The event is sent *continuously* while the slider is being dragged; this generally has a negative effect on performance. To mitigate this, consider using a :ref:`universal interaction trigger <lvgl-automation-triggers>` like ``on_release``, to get the ``x`` variable once after the interaction has completed.

The ``slider`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Number </components/number/lvgl>` or :doc:`Sensor </components/sensor/lvgl>` component.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-bright` and :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-volume` for examples which demonstrate how to use a slider to control entities in Home Assistant.

.. _lvgl-widget-spinbox:

``spinbox``
-----------

The spinbox contains a numeric value (as text) which can be increased or decreased through actions. You can, for example, use buttons labeled with plus and minus to call actions which increase or decrease the value as required.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_spinbox.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **anim_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`Time <config-time>`): Sets the cursor's blink time.

- **digits** (*Optional*, 1..10): The number of digits (excluding the decimal separator and the sign characters).  Defaults to ``4``.
- **range_from** (*Optional*, float): The minimum value allowed to set the spinbox to. Defaults to ``0``.
- **range_to** (*Optional*, float): The maximum value allowed to set the spinbox to. Defaults to ``100``.
- **rollover** (*Optional*, boolean): While increasing or decreasing the value, if either the minimum or maximum value is reached with this option enabled, the value will change to the other limit. If disabled, the value will remain at the minimum or maximum value. Defaults to ``false``.
- **step** (*Optional*, float): The granularity with which the value can be set. Defaults to ``1.0``.
- **value** (**Required**, float): Actual value to be shown by the spinbox at start.

.. note::

    The sign character will only be shown if the set range contains negatives.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.spinbox.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties from the specific options above, just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of spinbox widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

- ``lvgl.spinbox.increment`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` increases the value by one ``step`` configured above.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID of the spinbox widget which you want to increment.

- ``lvgl.spinbox.decrement`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` decreases the value by one ``step`` configured above.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID of the spinbox widget which you want to decrement.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when the knob changes the value of the arc. The new value is returned in the variable ``x``.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - spinbox:
        id: spinbox_id
        text_align: center
        range_from: -10
        range_to: 40
        step: 0.5
        digits: 3
        decimal_places: 1

    # Example actions:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.spinbox.decrement: spinbox_id
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.spinbox.update:
            id: spinbox_id
            value: 25.5

    # Example trigger:
    - spinbox:
        ...
        on_value:
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Spinbox value is %f"
                args: [ x ]

The ``spinbox`` can be also integrated as a :doc:`Number </components/number/lvgl>` or :doc:`Sensor </components/sensor/lvgl>` component.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-climate` for an example which demonstrates how to implement a thermostat control using the spinbox.

.. _lvgl-widget-spinner:

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.spinner.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget styles and properties for the *indicator* part (anything other than the properties that apply commonly to all widgets), just like the :ref:`lvgl.widget.update <lvgl-automation-actions>` action is used for the common styles, states or flags.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of spinner widgets to be updated.
    - Widget styles or properties from the specific options above, to be updated.

**Triggers:**

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - spinner:
        align: center
        spin_time: 2s
        arc_length: 60deg
        id: spinner_id
        indicator:
          arc_color: 0xd4d4d4

    # Example action:
    on_...:

- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers which also return the value in ``x``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - switch:
        x: 10
        y: 10
        id: switch_id

                format: "Switch state: %d"
                args: [ x ]

The ``switch`` can be also integrated as a :doc:`Switch </components/switch/lvgl>` component.

See :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-relay` for an example which demonstrates how to use a switch to act on a local component.

.. _lvgl-widget-tabview:

``tabview``
-----------

The tab view object can be used to organize content in tabs. The tab buttons are internally generated with a :ref:`lvgl-widget-buttonmatrix`.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_tabview.png
    :align: center

The tabs are indexed (zero-based) in the order they appear in the configuration file. A new tab can be selected either by clicking on a tab button, by sliding horizontally on the content or via the ``lvgl.tabview.select`` :ref:`action <actions-action>`, specifying the tab's index.

**Configuration variables:**

- **position** (*Optional*, enum): Position of the tab selector buttons. One of ``TOP``, ``BOTTOM``, ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``. Defaults to ``TOP``.
- **size** (*Optional*, percentage): The height (in case of ``TOP``, ``BOTTOM``) or width (in case of ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``) tab buttons. Defaults to ``10%``.

    - **id** (**Required**): The ID of the tabview which receives this action.
    - **index** (**Required**): The (zero-based) index of the tab to which to jump.
    - **animated** (*Optional*, boolean): To animate the movement. Defaults to ``false``.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when displayed tab changes. The new value is returned in the variable ``tab`` as the ID of the now-visible tab.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - tabview:
        id: tabview_id
        position: top
        tab_style:
          border_color: 0x00FF00
          border_width: 6
          items:
            text_color: 0x0000FF
        tabs:
          - name: Dog
            id: tabview_tab_1
            widgets:
              - image:
                  src: dog_img
              ...
          ...

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.tabview.select:
            id: tabview_id
            index: 1
            animated: true

    # Example trigger:
    - tabview:
        ...
        on_value:
          then:
            - if:
                condition:
                  lambda: return tab == id(tabview_tab_1);
                then:
                  - logger.log: "Dog tab is now showing"

.. _lvgl-widget-textarea:

``textarea``
------------

The textarea is an extended label widget which displays a cursor and allows the user to input text. Long lines are wrapped and when the text becomes long enough the text area can be scrolled. It supports one line mode and password mode, where typed characters are replaced visually with bullets or asterisks.

.. figure:: /components/lvgl/images/lvgl_textarea.png
    :align: center

**Configuration variables:**

- **accepted_chars** (*Optional*, string): You can set a list of accepted characters, so other characters will be ignored.
- **max_length** (*Optional*, int): Limit the maximum number of characters to this value.
- **one_line** (*Optional*, boolean): The text area can be limited to only allow a single line of text. In this case the height will set automatically to fit only one line, line break characters will be ignored, and word wrap will be disabled.
- **password_mode** (*Optional*, boolean): The text area supports password mode. By default, if the ``•`` (bullet, ``0x2022``) glyph exists in the font, the entered characters are converted to it after some time or when a new character is entered. If ``•`` is missing from the font, ``*`` (asterisk) will be used.
- **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): Initial contents of the textarea.
- **placeholder_text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): A placeholder text can be specified, which is displayed when the Text area is empty.
- any :ref:`Styling <lvgl-styling>` and state-based option for the background of the textarea. Uses all the typical background style properties and the text/label related style properties for the text.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.textarea.update`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` updates the widget's ``text`` property, to replace the entire text content.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of textarea widgets to be updated.
    - **text** (*Optional*, :ref:`text-property`): The text to replace the textarea content.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated on every keystroke.
- ``on_ready`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when ``one_line`` is configured as ``true`` and the newline character is received (Enter/Ready key on the keyboard).
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

For both triggers above, when triggered, the variable ``text`` (``std::string`` type) is available for use in lambdas within these triggers and it will contain the entire contents of the textarea.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - textarea:
        id: textarea_id
        one_line: true
        placeholder_text: "Enter text here"

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.textarea.update:
            id: textarea_id
            text: "Hello World!"

    # Example trigger:
    - textarea:
        ...
        on_value:
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Textarea changed to: %s"
                args: [ text.c_str() ]
        on_ready:
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Textarea ready: %s"
                args: [ text.c_str() ]

The ``textarea`` can be also integrated as :doc:`Text </components/text/lvgl>` or :doc:`Text Sensor </components/text_sensor/lvgl>` component.

.. _lvgl-widget-tileview:

``tileview``
------------

The tileview is a container object whose elements, called tiles, can be arranged in grid form. A user can navigate between the tiles by dragging or swiping. Any direction can be disabled on the tiles individually to not allow moving from one tile to another.

If the tileview is screen sized, the user interface resembles what you may have seen on smartwatches. The tileview has parts ``main`` and ``scrollbar``.

**Configuration variables:**

- **tiles** (**Required**, list): A list with (any number of) tiles to be added to tileview.
    - **column** (**Required**): Vertical position of the tile in the tileview grid.
    - **row** (**Required**): Horizontal position of the tile in the tileview grid.
    - **dir** (*Optional*): Enable moving to adjacent tiles in the given direction by swiping/dragging. One (or multiple as YAML list) of ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``, ``TOP``, ``BOTTOM``, ``HOR``, ``VER``, ``ALL``. Defaults to ``ALL``.
    - **id** (*Optional*): A tile ID to be used with the ``lvgl.tileview.select`` action.
    - **widgets** (*Optional*, list): A list of :doc:`/components/lvgl/widgets` to be drawn on the tile, as children.

**Actions:**

- ``lvgl.tileview.select`` :ref:`action <actions-action>` jumps the ``tileview`` to the desired tile:
    - **animated** (*Optional*, boolean): To animate the movement. Defaults to ``false``.
    - **column** (*Optional*): Vertical position of the tile to which to jump. Required if not specifying ``tile_id``.
    - **row** (*Optional*): Horizontal position of the tile to which to jump. Required if not specifying ``tile_id``.
    - **id** (**Required**): The ID of the tileview which receives this action.
    - **tile_id** (*Optional*): The ID of the tile (from within the tileview) to which to jump. Required if not specifying ``row`` and ``column``.

**Triggers:**

- ``on_value`` :ref:`trigger <actions-trigger>` is activated when displayed tile changes. The new value is returned in the variable ``tile`` as the ID of the now-visible tile.
- :ref:`interaction <lvgl-automation-triggers>` LVGL event triggers.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example widget:
    - tileview:
        id: tiv_id
        tiles:
          - id: cat_tile
            row: 0
            column: 0
            dir: VER
            widgets:
              - image:
                  src: cat_image
              - ...
          - ...

    # Example action:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.tileview.select:
            id: tiv_id
            tile_id: cat_tile
            animated: true

    # Example trigger:
    - tileview:
        ...
        on_value:
          - if:
              condition:
                lambda: return tile == id(cat_tile);
              then:
                - logger.log: "Cat tile is now showing"

.. _lvgl-automations:

Automations
-----------

.. _lvgl-automation-actions:

Actions
*******

As outlined in the sections above, each widget type supports several of its own, unique actions.
Several universal actions are also available for all widgets, these are outlined below.

``lvgl.widget.update``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This powerful :ref:`action <actions-action>` allows changing/updating any widget's common :ref:`style property <lvgl-styling>`, state (templatable) or :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>` on the fly.

- **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of widgets configured in LVGL to be updated.
- The widget's common :ref:`style property <lvgl-styling>`, state (templatable) or :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example for updating styles (in states):
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.widget.update:
            id: my_button_id
            bg_color: 0xFF0000
            state:
              disabled: true

    # Example for updating flag:
    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.widget.update:
            id: my_label_id
            hidden: true

Check out in the Cookbook :ref:`lvgl-cookbook-binent` for an example which demonstrates how to use a template to update the state.

.. _lvgl-automation-shorthands:

``lvgl.widget.hide``, ``lvgl.widget.show``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These :ref:`actions <actions-action>` are shorthands for toggling the ``hidden`` :ref:`flag <lvgl-widget-flags>` of any widget.

- **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of widgets configured in LVGL which you want to hide or show.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - lvgl.widget.hide: my_label_id                # a single widget
        - lvgl.widget.show: [my_button_1, my_button_2] # a list of widgets
        - delay: 0.5s
        - lvgl.widget.show:
            -id: my_label_id
        - lvgl.widget.hide:
            - id: [my_button_1, my_button_2]

``lvgl.widget.disable``, ``lvgl.widget.enable``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These :ref:`actions <actions-action>` are shorthands for toggling the ``disabled`` state of any widget (which controls the appearance of the corresponding *disabled* style set of the theme):

- **id** (**Required**): The ID or a list of IDs of widgets configured in LVGL which you want to disable or enable.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - on_...:
        then:
          - lvgl.widget.disable:
              - my_button_1
              - my_button_2

    - on_...:
        then:
          - lvgl.widget.enable:
              - id: my_button_1
              - id: my_button_2

.. _lvgl-automation-triggers:

Triggers
********

Specific triggers like ``on_value`` are available for certain widgets; they are described above in their respective section.
Some universal triggers are also available for all of the widgets:

ESPHome implements as universal triggers the following interaction events generated by LVGL:

- ``on_press``: The widget has been pressed.
- ``on_long_press``: The widget has been pressed for at least the ``long_press_time`` specified in the input device configuration. Not called if scrolled.
- ``on_long_press_repeat``: Called after ``long_press_time`` in every ``long_press_repeat_time`` ms. Not called if scrolled.
- ``on_short_click``: The widget was pressed for a short period of time, then released. Not called if scrolled or long pressed.
- ``on_click``: Called on release if a widget did not scroll (regardless of long press).
- ``on_release``: Called in every case when a widget has been released.
- ``on_scroll_begin``: Scrolling of the widget begins.
- ``on_scroll_end``:  Scrolling of the widget ends.
- ``on_scroll``: The widget was scrolled.
- ``on_focus``:  The widget is focused.
- ``on_defocus``: The widget is unfocused.
- ``on_all_events``: Will be triggered on any event sent to the widget - this is useful for debugging.

These triggers can be applied directly to any widget in the LVGL configuration, *given that the widget itself supports generating such events*. For the widgets having a value, the triggers return the current value in variable ``x``; this variable may be used in lambdas defined within those triggers.

Each trigger also deliver an ``event`` parameter, which is a pointer to the LVGL C type ``lv_event_t``. This may be used in lambdas defined within those triggers. Refer to the `LVGL documentation <https://docs.lvgl.io/8.4/overview/event.html/>`_ for more information.

There are additional triggers for pages - each page may have an ``on_load`` and ``on_unload`` trigger. These will be called
when the page becomes active or inactive respectively.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example triggers:
    - button:
        ...
        on_short_click:
          then:
            lvgl.page.show: main_page
        on_long_press:
          then:
            light.toggle: display_backlight

    - slider:
        ...
        on_release:
          then:
            - light.turn_on:
                id: display_backlight
                transition_length: 0ms
                brightness: !lambda return x / 100;
