The ``gps`` component allows you to connect GPS modules to your ESPHome project.
Any GPS module that uses the standardized NMEA communication protocol will work.

For this component to work you need to have set up a :ref:`UART bus <uart>`
in your configuration - only the RX pin should be necessary.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry

    # Declare GPS module
    gps:
      latitude:
        name: "Latitude"
      longitude:
        name: "Longitude"
      altitude:
        name: "Altitude"

    # GPS as time source
    time:
      - platform: gps

The component is split up in platforms, by defining the GPS module
(as seen above).

In addition to retrieving GPS position data, the module can also be used as a
time platform to get the current date and time via the very accurate GPS clocks
without a network connection.

See :doc:`time/gps` for config options for the GPS time source.
