The ``gps`` component allows you to connect GPS modules to your ESPHome project.
Any GPS module that uses the standardized NMEA communication protocol will work.

For this integration to work you need to have set up a :ref:`UART bus <uart>`
in your configuration - only the RX pin should be necessary.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    uart:
      rx_pin: D0
      baud_rate: 9600

    # Declare GPS module
    gps:

    # GPS as time source
    time:
      - platform: gps

The component is split up in platforms. No configuration variables.

First you need to define a global GPS module hub (as seen above).

Currently, the only data that can be extracted from GPS is the current time.
GPS can be used as a time platform to get the current date and time via the
very accurate GPS clocks that are also independent of any network connection.

See :doc:`time` for config options for the GPS time source.
