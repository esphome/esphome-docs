    :description: Instructions for setting up base covers in ESPHome.
    :image: folder-open.svg

The ``cover`` component is a generic representation of covers in ESPHome.
A cover can (currently) either be *closed* or *open* and supports three types of
commands: *open*, *close* and *stop*.

.. _config-cover:

Base Cover Configuration
------------------------

All cover config schemas inherit from this schema - you can set these keys for covers.

.. code-block:: yaml

    cover:
      - platform: ...
        device_class: garage

Configuration variables:

- **id** (*Optional*, string): Manually specify the ID for code generation. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.
- **name** (*Optional*, string): The name for the cover. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.

  .. note::

      If you have a :ref:`friendly_name <esphome-configuration_variables>` set for your device and
      you want the cover to use that name, you can set ``name: None``.

- **device_class** (*Optional*, string): The device class for the
  sensor. See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover/#device-class for a list of available options.
- **icon** (*Optional*, icon): Manually set the icon to use for the cover in the frontend.

Advanced options:

- **internal** (*Optional*, boolean): Mark this component as internal. Internal components will
  not be exposed to the frontend (like Home Assistant). Only specifying an ``id`` without
  a ``name`` will implicitly set this to true.
- **disabled_by_default** (*Optional*, boolean): If true, then this entity should not be added to any client's frontend,
  (usually Home Assistant) without the user manually enabling it (via the Home Assistant UI).
  Defaults to ``false``.
- **entity_category** (*Optional*, string): The category of the entity.
  See https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#generic-properties
  for a list of available options.
  Set to ``""`` to remove the default entity category.

MQTT options:

- **position_state_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to publish
  cover position changes to.
- **position_command_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to receive
  cover position commands on.
- **tilt_state_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to publish cover
  cover tilt state changes to.
- **tilt_command_topic** (*Optional*, string): The topic to receive
  cover tilt commands on.
- All other options from :ref:`MQTT Component <config-mqtt-component>`.
- If Webserver enabled, ``web_server_sorting_weight`` can be set. See :ref:`Webserver Entity Sorting <config-webserver-sorting>`.


.. _cover-open_action:

``cover.open`` Action
---------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` opens the cover with the given ID when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - cover.open: cover_1

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(cover_1).make_call();
        call.set_command_open();
        call.perform();

.. _cover-close_action:

``cover.close`` Action
----------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` closes the cover with the given ID when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - cover.close: cover_1

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(cover_1).make_call();
        call.set_command_close();
        call.perform();

.. _cover-stop_action:

``cover.stop`` Action
---------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` stops the cover with the given ID when executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - cover.stop: cover_1

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(cover_1).make_call();
        call.set_command_stop();
        call.perform();

.. _cover-toggle_action:

``cover.toggle`` Action
-----------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` toggles the cover with the given ID when executed,
cycling through the states close/stop/open/stop... This allows the cover to be controlled
by a single push button.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - cover.toggle: cover_1

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(cover_1).make_call();
        call.set_command_toggle();
        call.perform();

.. _cover-control_action:

``cover.control`` Action
------------------------

This :ref:`action <config-action>` is a more generic version of the other cover actions and
allows all cover attributes to be set.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - cover.control:
            id: cover_1
            position: 50%
            tilt: 50%

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The cover to control.
- **stop** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to stop the cover.
- **state** (*Optional*, string): The state to set the cover to - one of ``OPEN`` or ``CLOSE``.
- **position** (*Optional*, float): The cover position to set.

  - ``0.0`` = ``0%`` = ``CLOSED``
  - ``1.0`` = ``100%`` = ``OPEN``

- **tilt** (*Optional*, float): The tilt position to set. In range 0% - 100%.

.. note::

    This action can also be expressed in :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto call = id(cover_1).make_call();
        // set attributes
        call.set_position(0.5);
        call.perform();

.. _cover-lambda_calls:

Lambdas
-------

From :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can access the current state of the cover (note that these
fields are read-only, if you want to act on the cover, use the ``make_call()`` method as shown above).

- ``position``: Retrieve the current position of the cover, as a value between ``0.0`` (closed) and ``1.0`` (open).

    .. code-block:: cpp

        if (id(my_cover).position == COVER_OPEN) {
          // Cover is open
        } else if (id(my_cover).position == COVER_CLOSED) {
          // Cover is closed
        } else {
          // Cover is in-between open and closed
        }

- ``tilt``: Retrieve the current tilt position of the cover, as a value between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``.

- ``current_operation``: The operation the cover is currently performing:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        if (id(my_cover).current_operation == CoverOperation::COVER_OPERATION_IDLE) {
          // Cover is idle
        } else if (id(my_cover).current_operation == CoverOperation::COVER_OPERATION_OPENING) {
          // Cover is currently opening
        } else if (id(my_cover).current_operation == CoverOperation::COVER_OPERATION_CLOSING) {
          // Cover is currently closing
        }

.. _cover-on_open_trigger:

``cover.on_open`` Trigger
*************************

This trigger is activated each time the cover reaches a fully open state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    cover:
      - platform: template  # or any other platform
        # ...
        on_open:
          - logger.log: "Cover is Open!"

.. _cover-on_closed_trigger:

``cover.on_closed`` Trigger
***************************

This trigger is activated each time the cover reaches a fully closed state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    cover:
      - platform: template  # or any other platform
        # ...
        on_closed:
          - logger.log: "Cover is Closed!"
