    :image: remote.svg
    :keywords: RF, infrared

The ``remote_receiver`` component lets you receive and decode any remote signal, these can
for example be infrared remotes or 433MHz signals.

The component is split up into two parts: the remote receiver hub which
handles setting the pin and some other settings, and individual
:ref:`remote receiver binary sensors <remote-receiver-binary-sensor>`
which will trigger when they hear their own configured signal.

**See** :ref:`remote-setting-up-infrared` **and** :ref:`remote-setting-up-rf` **for set up guides.**

    # Example configuration entry

.. note::

    The **CanalSat** and **CanalSatLD** protocols use a higher carrier frequency (56khz) and are very similar.
    Depending on the hardware used they may interfere with each other when enabled simultaneously.


.. note::

    **NEC codes**: In version 2021.12, the order of transferring bits was corrected from MSB to LSB in accordance with the NEC standard.
    Therefore, if the configuration file has come from an earlier version of ESPhome, it is necessary to reverse the order of the address
    and command bits when moving to 2021.12 or above. For example, address: 0x84ED, command: 0x13EC becomes 0xB721 and 0x37C8 respectively.


.. note::

    To capture the codes more effectively with directly connected receiver like tsop38238 you can try to use ``INPUT_PULLUP``:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        remote_receiver:
          pin:
            number: GPIOXX
            inverted: true
            mode:
              input: true
              pullup: true
          dump: all


.. note::

    For the Sonoff RF Bridge, you can bypass the EFM8BB1 microcontroller handling RF signals with
    `this hack <https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/Hardware-Itead-Sonoff-RF-Bridge---Direct-Hack>`__
    created by the GitHub user wildwiz. Then use this configuration for the remote receiver/transmitter hubs:
