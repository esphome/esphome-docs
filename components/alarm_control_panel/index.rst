Base Alarm Control Panel Configuration
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      - platform: ...
        name: Alarm Panel


Configuration variables:

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the alarm control panel.

  .. note::

      If you have a :ref:`friendly_name <esphome-configuration_variables>` set for your device and
      you want the switch to use that name, you can set ``name: None``.

- **on_state** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm changes state. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_state_trigger`.
- **on_arming** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``arming``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_arming_trigger`.
- **on_pending** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``pending``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_pending_trigger`.
- **on_armed_home** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``armed_home``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_armed_home_trigger`.
- **on_armed_night** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``armed_night``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_armed_night_trigger`.
- **on_armed_away** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``armed_away``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_armed_away_trigger`.
- **on_triggered** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm triggers. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_triggered_trigger`.
- **on_disarmed** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm state changes to ``disarmed``. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_disarmed_trigger`.
- **on_cleared** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the alarm clears. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_cleared_trigger`.
- **on_ready** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when the logical 'and' of all the zone sensors change state. See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_ready_trigger`.
- **on_chime** (*Optional*, :ref:`Action <config-action>`): An automation to perform
  when a zone has been marked as chime in the configuration, and it changes from closed to open. 
  See :ref:`alarm_control_panel_on_chime_trigger`.


Automation:
-----------

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_state_trigger:

``on_state`` Trigger
********************

This trigger is activated each time the alarm changes state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_state:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Panel State Changed!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_pending_trigger:

``on_pending`` Trigger
**********************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to pending state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_pending:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Pending!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_arming_trigger:

``on_arming`` Trigger
*********************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to arming state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_arming:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Arming!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_armed_home_trigger:

``on_armed_home`` Trigger
*************************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to armed_home state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_armed_home:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm armed_home!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_armed_night_trigger:

``on_armed_night`` Trigger
**************************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to armed_night state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_armed_night:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm armed_night!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_armed_away_trigger:

``on_armed_away`` Trigger
*************************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to armed_away state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_armed_away:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm armed_away!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_triggered_trigger:

``on_triggered`` Trigger
************************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes to triggered state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_triggered:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Triggered!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_cleared_trigger:

``on_cleared`` Trigger
**********************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes from triggered back to either the previous armed state or disarmed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_cleared:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Cleared!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_disarmed_trigger:

``on_disarmed`` Trigger
***********************

This trigger is activated when the alarm changes from to disarmed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_disarmed:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Disarmed!"

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_ready_trigger:

``on_ready`` Trigger
********************

This trigger is activated when the logical 'and' of all the alarm sensors change state. This is useful for implementing "alarm ready" LEDs.
Once this trigger is called, you can get the ready state by calling get_all_sensors_ready() in a lambda block.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_disarmed:
        then:

              ESP_LOGI("AlarmPanel", "Sensor ready change to: %s", ((id(acp1).get_all_sensors_ready()) ? (const char *) "True" : (const char *) "False"));

.. _alarm_control_panel_on_chime_trigger:

``on_chime`` Trigger
********************

This trigger is activated when a zone sensor marked with chime:true changes from closed to open. This is useful for implementing keypad chimes when a zone
opens.

.. code-block:: yaml

    alarm_control_panel:
      # ...
      on_chime:
        then:
          - logger.log: "Alarm Chime!"

            id: acp1
            code: "1234"

.. _alarm_control_panel_disarm_action:

``disarm`` Action
*****************

This action disarms the alarm. The ``code`` is required when *codes* is not empty.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - alarm_control_panel.disarm:
            id: acp1
            code: "1234"

.. _alarm_control_panel_pending_action:

``pending`` Action
******************

This action puts the alarm in pending state (the state before triggered after *pending_time*).

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - alarm_control_panel.pending: acp1

.. _alarm_control_panel_triggered_action:

``triggered`` Action
********************

This action puts the alarm in triggered state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      then:
        - alarm_control_panel.triggered: acp1

.. _alarm_control_panel_is_armed_condition:

``is_armed`` Condition
**********************

This :ref:`Condition <config-condition>` checks if the alarm control panel is armed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on_...:
      if:
        condition:
          alarm_control_panel.is_armed: acp1


.. _alarm_control_panel_lambda_calls:

lambda calls
************

From :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`, you can call the following methods:

- ``arm_away(code)``
- ``arm_home(code)``
- ``arm_night(code)``
- ``disarm(code)``
- ``get_all_sensors_ready()``

.. code-block:: cpp

    id(acp1).arm_away();
    id(acp1).arm_home();
    id(acp1).arm_night();
    id(acp1).disarm(std::string("1234"));
    bool all_sensors_ready = id(acp1).get_all_sensors_ready();
