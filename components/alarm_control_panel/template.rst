    :description: Instructions for setting up template Alarm Control Panels in ESPHome.
    :image: description.svg

The ``template`` alarm control panel platform allows you to turn your binary sensors into a state machine
managed alarm control panel.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    alarm_control_panel:
      - platform: template
        name: Alarm Panel
        codes:
          - "1234"
        binary_sensors:
          - input: zone_1
          - input: zone_2
            bypass_armed_home: true

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **codes** (*Optional*, list of string): A list of codes for disarming the alarm, if *requires_code_to_arm* set to true then for arming the alarm too.
- **requires_code_to_arm** (*Optional*, boolean): Code required for arming the alarm, *codes* must be provided.
- **arming_away_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The exit delay before the alarm is armed to away mode. Defaults to ``0s``.
- **arming_home_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The exit delay before the alarm is armed to home mode.  
- **arming_night_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The exit delay before the alarm is armed to night mode.  
- **pending_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The entry delay before the alarm is triggered. Defaults to ``0s``.
- **trigger_time** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The time after a triggered alarm before resetting to previous state if the sensors are cleared/off. Defaults to ``0s``.
- **binary_sensors** (*Optional*, *list*): A list of binary sensors the panel should use. Each consists of:

  - **input** (**Required**, string): The id of the binary sensor component
  - **bypass_armed_home** (*Optional*, boolean): This binary sensor will not trigger the alarm when in ``armed_home`` state.
  - **bypass_armed_night** (*Optional*, boolean): This binary sensor will not trigger the alarm when in ``armed_night`` state.
  - **trigger_mode** (*Optional*, string): Sets the trigger mode for this sensor. One of ``delayed``, ``instant``, or ``interior_follower``. (``delayed`` is the default if not specified)
  - **chime** (*Optional*, boolean): When set ``true``, the chime callback will be called whenever the sensor goes from closed to open. (``false`` is the default if not specified)

- **restore_mode** (*Optional*, enum):

  - ``ALWAYS_DISARMED`` (Default): Always start in ``disarmed`` state.
  - ``RESTORE_DEFAULT_DISARMED``: Restore state or default to ``disarmed`` state if no saved state was found.

- All other options from :ref:`Alarm Control Panel <config-alarm_control_panel>`

.. note::

    If ``binary_sensors`` is omitted then you're expected to trigger the alarm using
    :ref:`alarm_control_panel_pending_action` or :ref:`alarm_control_panel_triggered_action`.


.. _template_alarm_control_panel-state_flow:

State Flow:
-----------

1. The alarm starts in ``DISARMED`` state
2. When the ``arm_...`` method is invoked

  a. ``arming_..._time`` is greater than 0 the state is ``ARMING``
  b. ``arming_..._time`` is 0 or after the delay the state is ``ARMED_...``

3. When the alarm is tripped by a sensor state changing to ``on`` or ``alarm_control_panel_pending_action`` invoked

  1. If trigger_mode is set to ``delayed``:

    1. ``pending_time`` greater than 0 the state is ``PENDING``
    2. ``pending_time`` is 0 or after the ``pending_time`` delay the state is ``TRIGGERED``

  2. If trigger_mode is set to ``instant``:

    1. The state is set to ``TRIGGERED``

  3. If the trigger_mode is set to ``interior_follower``:

    1. If the current state is ``ARMED_...`` the state will be set to ``TRIGGERED``
    2. If the current state is ``PENDING`` then nothing will happen and it will stay in the ``PENDING`` state.

4. If ``trigger_time`` greater than 0 and no sensors are ``on`` after ``trigger_time`` delay
   the state returns to ``ARM_...``

.. note::

    Although the interface supports all arming modes only ``away``, ``home`` and ``night`` have been implemented for now.
    ``arm_...`` is for either ``arm_away`` or ``arm_home``
    ``arming_..._time`` is for either ``arming_away_time``, ``arming_home_time``, or ``arming_night_time``
    ``ARMED_...`` is for either ``ARMED_AWAY``, ``ARMED_HOME``, or ``ARMED_NIGHT``
