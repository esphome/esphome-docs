I²S Audio Speaker
=================

The ``i2s_audio`` speaker platform allows you to receive audio via the the :doc:`/components/i2s_audio`.

This platform only works on ESP32 based chips.

.. warning::

    Audio and voice components consume a significant amount of resources (RAM, CPU) on the device.

    **Crashes are likely to occur** if you include too many additional components in your device's
    configuration. In particular, Bluetooth/BLE components are known to cause issues when used in
    combination with Voice Assistant and/or other audio components.

    # Example configuration entry
    speaker:
      - platform: i2s_audio
        dac_type: external
        i2s_dout_pin: GPIOXX

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **dac_type** (**Required**, enum):

  - ``external``: Use an external DAC, for example the NS4168, or UDA1334A.
  - ``internal``: Use the internal DAC

- **channel** (*Optional*, enum): The channel of the speaker. One of ``left``, ``right``, ``mono``, or ``stereo``. If ``stereo``, the input data should be twice as big,
  with each right sample followed by a left sample. ``left`` and ``right`` mute the unused channel, while ``mono`` plays the same samples on both. Defaults to ``mono``.
- **sample_rate** (*Optional*, positive integer): I2S sample rate. Defaults to ``16000``.
- **bits_per_sample** (*Optional*, enum): The bit depth of the audio samples. Note that while set to ``24bit`` or ``32bit``, the samples
  will be scaled up from 16bit before being forwarded. One of ``8bit``, ``16bit``, ``24bit``, or ``32bit``. Defaults to ``16bit``.
- **bits_per_channel** (*Optional*, enum): The bit depth of the audio channels. See the datasheet of your I2S device for details. Defaults to ``bits_per_sample``.
- **use_apll** (*Optional*, boolean): I2S using APLL as main I2S clock, enable it to get accurate clock. Defaults to ``false``.
- **i2s_mode** (*Optional*, enum): The I²S mode to use. One of ``primary`` (clock driven by the host) or ``secondary`` (clock driven by the attached device). Defaults to ``primary``.
- **i2s_audio_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The ID of the :ref:`I²S Audio <i2s_audio>` you wish to use for this speaker.
- **i2s_comm_fmt** (*Optional*, enum): The I²S communication standard format used by this speaker.

  - ``stand_i2s`` (Default)
  - ``stand_msb``
  - ``stand_pcm_short``
  - ``stand_pcm_long``
  - ``stand_max``
  - ``i2s_msb``
  - ``i2s_lsb``
  - ``pcm``
  - ``pcm_short``
  - ``pcm_long``
- **timeout** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): How long to wait after finishing playback before releasing the bus. Defaults to ``100ms``.

External DAC
************

- **i2s_dout_pin** (**Required**, :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`): The GPIO pin to use for the I²S DOUT (Data Out) signal.

For best results, keep the wires as short as possible.

Internal DAC
************

- **mode** (**Required**, enum): The channel mode of the internal DAC.

  - ``left``
  - ``right``
  - ``stereo``
