Privacy Policy
==============

*Effective date: December 31, 2018*

The esphomelib team ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://esphomelib.com/ and https://esphome.io/ website
(the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use
our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection And Use
------------------------------

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

We may also collect information how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include
information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type,
browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit,
the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze
this type of information in order to increase our Service's functionality. These third party
service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
-----------------------------------------------

Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying
information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who create a forum account to provide a username and an email address.
Those who engage in transactions with us are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the
personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, we collect such information
only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction. Visitors can always
refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.

Service Providers
-----------------

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf,
to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

Google Analytics
****************

Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.
Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google
services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the
Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on (see http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

This website uses the anonymize IP function to crop your IP address in accordance with the IP masking requirements
of EU privacy laws. This means that your IP address is shortened so that it can not be used to identify you
and is no longer considered Personal Information.
