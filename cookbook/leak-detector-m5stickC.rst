    :description: Water leak detector with ESPHome on an M5StickC ESP32
    :keywords: Leak Detector M5StickC M5Stack M5Atom

Using the ESP32's capacitive touch GPIOs, it's relatively easy to build a water leak detector using ESPHome.  M5StickC was chosen as a platform due to the integrated Grove connector for clean connections and the fact it's well housed.  The built-in display is a bonus, but not strictly necessary.  Notifications are performed via HomeAssistant's 'alert' and 'notify' facilities, which send via Pushover to iOS & Android.

Things you'll need
==================

-  `M5Stick axp192 custom component <https://github.com/airy10/esphome-m5stickC>`__
    This is needed to power up the display.  You don't need the st7735 display driver, as it is already included with ESPHome >1.16.0.

-  Moisture sensor
    This example uses a `Guardian Remote Sensor Probe <https://amazon.com/Guardian-by-Elexa-Remote-Sensor/dp/B07G5BMD7L>`__
    which has a 6' cord.

- USB power supply with USB-C cable
    (the M5StickC comes with the short black USB cable seen in the pictures)

------------

Probe Connection
================

Since the probe comes with an integrated 3.5mm male plug, a 3.5mm female jack has been connected to the Grove port to allow easy probe replacement in the future.  Orange connects to orange, blue connects to blue.  The pads on the opposite side of the probe are internally-connected identically to the front.  The two middle rings on the 3.5mm jack are unused.  There is no polarity -- simply connect one terminal (orange or blue) to Grove GND, and the other to Grove G33.

Assembled Components
====================

.. note::

    Even though the M5StickC has a battery inside (which might be enough to cover short power outages), you'll need to keep
    the unit on USB power 24/7.

Display Font
============

You'll need to place the `OpenSans-Regular <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans>`__ font (or another of your choosing) alongside your ESPHome yaml file.  See - :doc:`/components/display/index`.

Calibration & Testing
=====================

Once everything is hooked up and flashed, enable ``esp32_touch:`` ``setup_mode: true`` and proceed to adjust the threshold setting on the touch-sensitive binary sensor (GPIO33) to find the proper value for your particular moisture sensor and cabling situation.  Grab a glass of water for testing, another for yourself, and dip away while watching the logs.  Your goal is to find a threshold value that is sufficient to trigger the binary sensor in water, but not otherwise.  See :ref:`ESP32 Touch Pad <esp32-touch-binary-sensor>` for more information.

    alert:
      basement_water_leak:
        name: Water detected in the basement
        entity_id: binary_sensor.basement_leak_detector_sensor
        state: 'on'
        repeat: 30
        can_acknowledge: true
        notifiers:
          - water_leak_notification_group

    notify:
      - name: pushover
        platform: pushover
        api_key: !secret pushover_api_key
        user_key: !secret pushover_user_key
      - name: water_leak_notification_group
        platform: group
        services:
          - service: pushover
            data:
              data:
                # Pushover-provided sound effect (https://pushover.net/api#sounds)
                sound: alien


Enjoy your locally-controlled leak detector with push notification!
